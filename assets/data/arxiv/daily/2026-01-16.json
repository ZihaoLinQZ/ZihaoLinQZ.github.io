      "abstract": "We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

      "title": "DInf-Grid: A Neural Differential Equation Solver with Differentiable Feature Grids",
      "abstract": "We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.",

      "abstract": "Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.",

Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \\emph{high-quality} samples.\n  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \\emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \\emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.",

      "abstract": "We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.",

We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.\n  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.",

CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.",

      "abstract": "Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.",

Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.",

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.",

      "title": "Structure and Diversity Aware Context Bubble Construction for Enterprise Retrieval Augmented Systems",
      "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.",

      "abstract": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models \"reason\".",

Lossless compression using Huffman codes is an effective way to alleviate the issue, however, its three-stage design requiring on-the-fly frequency analysis, codebook generation and transmission of codebook along with data introduces computational, latency and data overheads which are prohibitive for latency-sensitive scenarios such as die-to-die communication. This paper proposes a single-stage Huffman encoder that eliminates these overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from the average probability distribution of previous data batches. Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.",

While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.",

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements.

However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\\textbf{Trac}ing \\textbf{V}erbalized \\textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.",

Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions. We demonstrate how violations of the sufficient conditions may lead to substantial breakdown, such as by producing a non-positive measure under traditional adjustment rather than one with mean 0, or by producing a measure which is deterministically 0 under statistical standardization.",

      "abstract": "Fine-grained sparsity promises higher parametric capacity without proportional per-token compute, but often suffers from training instability, load balancing, and communication overhead. We introduce STEM (Scaling Transformers with Embedding Modules), a static, token-indexed approach that replaces the FFN up-projection with a layer-local embedding lookup while keeping the gate and down-projection dense. This removes runtime routing, enables CPU offload with asynchronous prefetch, and decouples capacity from both per-token FLOPs and cross-device communication. Empirically, STEM trains stably despite extreme sparsity. It improves downstream performance over dense baselines while reducing per-token FLOPs and parameter accesses (eliminating roughly one-third of FFN parameters). STEM learns embedding spaces with large angular spread which enhances its knowledge storage capacity. More interestingly, this enhanced knowledge capacity comes with better interpretability. The token-indexed nature of STEM embeddings allows simple ways to perform knowledge editing and knowledge injection in an interpretable manner without any intervention in the input text or additional computation. In addition, STEM strengthens long-context performance: as sequence length grows, more distinct parameters are activated, yielding practical test-time capacity scaling. Across 350M and 1B model scales, STEM delivers up to ~3--4% accuracy improvements overall, with notable gains on knowledge and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, OpenBookQA, GSM8K, MMLU). Overall, STEM is an effective way of scaling parametric memory while providing better interpretability, better training stability and improved efficiency.",

To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions.

Within this framework, we study a family of oversampling procedures that augment the training data by generating synthetic samples from an estimated minority-class distribution to roughly balance the classes, among which the celebrated SMOTE algorithm is a canonical example. We show that the excess risk decomposes into the rate achievable under balanced training (as if the data had been drawn from the balanced target distribution) and an additional term, the cost of transfer, which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated and true minority-class distributions. In particular, we show that the cost of transfer for SMOTE dominates that of bootstrapping (random oversampling) in moderately high dimensions, suggesting that we should expect bootstrapping to have better performance than SMOTE in general. We corroborate these findings with experimental evidence. More broadly, our results provide guidance for choosing among augmentation strategies for imbalanced classification.",

We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).",

      "abstract": "Adaptive video streaming has facilitated improved video streaming over the past years. A balance among coding performance objectives such as bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity is required to achieve efficient, content- and codec-dependent, adaptive video streaming. This paper proposes a multi-objective Pareto-front (PF) optimization framework to construct quality-monotonic, content-adaptive bitrate ladders Versatile Video Coding (VVC) streaming that jointly optimize video quality, bitrate, and decoding time, which is used as a practical proxy for decoding energy. Two strategies are introduced: the Joint Rate-Quality-Time Pareto Front (JRQT-PF) and the Joint Quality-Time Pareto Front (JQT-PF), each exploring different tradeoff formulations and objective prioritizations. The ladders are constructed under quality monotonicity constraints during adaptive streaming to ensure a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE). Experiments are conducted on a large-scale UHD dataset (Inter-4K), with quality assessed using PSNR, VMAF, and XPSNR, and complexity measured via decoding time and energy consumption. The JQT-PF method achieves 11.76% average bitrate savings while reducing average decoding time by 0.29% to maintain the same XPSNR, compared to a widely-used fixed ladder. More aggressive configurations yield up to 27.88% bitrate savings at the cost of increased complexity. The JRQT-PF strategy, on the other hand, offers more controlled tradeoffs, achieving 6.38 % bitrate savings and 6.17 % decoding time reduction. This framework outperforms existing methods, including fixed ladders, VMAF- and XPSNR-based dynamic resolution selection, and complexity-aware benchmarks. The results confirm that PF optimization with decoding time constraints enables sustainable, high-quality streaming tailored to network and device capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.",

However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.",

      "abstract": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.",

The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage.

One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable.

      "abstract": "Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.",

      "abstract": "Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.",

Rooted in Kolmogorov's representation theorem, KANs utilize adaptive spline-based activation functions and grid-based structures, providing a transformative approach compared to traditional neural network frameworks. Utilizing a variety of datasets spanning mathematical function estimation (quadratic and cubic) to practical uses like predicting daily temperatures and categorizing wines, the proposed research thoroughly assesses model performance via accuracy measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and computational expense assessed through Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). The results indicate that KANs reliably exceed MLPs in every benchmark, attaining higher predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs. Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments. By elucidating the architectural and functional distinctions between KANs and MLPs, the paper provides a systematic framework for selecting the most suitable neural architectures for specific tasks. Furthermore, the proposed study highlights the transformative capabilities of KANs in progressing intelligent systems, influencing their use in situations that require both interpretability and computational efficiency.",

To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.",

While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models.

The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\\% train, 10\\% validation, and 10\\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

      "abstract": "The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.",

We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.",

Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.",

To address these, we introduce DR-Arena, a fully automated evaluation framework that pushes DR agents to their capability limits through dynamic investigation. DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from fresh web trends to ensure the evaluation rubric is synchronized with the live world state, and employs an automated Examiner to generate structured tasks testing two orthogonal capabilities: Deep reasoning and Wide coverage. DR-Arena further adopts Adaptive Evolvement Loop, a state-machine controller that dynamically escalates task complexity based on real-time performance, demanding deeper deduction or wider aggregation until a decisive capability boundary emerges. Experiments with six advanced DR agents demonstrate that DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard. This represents the state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences without any manual efforts, validating DR-Arena as a reliable alternative for costly human adjudication.",

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \\emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \\emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.",

Unprecedented volumes of consumption data from a continuing global deployment of smart meters enable consumer segmentation based on real usage behaviours, promising to inform the design of more effective DSM and DR programs. However, existing clustering-based segmentation methods insufficiently reflect the behavioural diversity of consumers, often relying on rigid temporal alignment, and faltering in the presence of anomalies, missing data, or large-scale deployments.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage clustering framework -- Clustered Representations Optimising Consumer Segmentation (CROCS). In the first stage, each consumer's daily load profiles are clustered independently to form a Representative Load Set (RLS), providing a compact summary of their typical diurnal consumption behaviours. In the second stage, consumers are clustered using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD), a novel set-to-set measure that compares RLSs by accounting for both the prevalence and similarity of those behaviours. Finally, community detection on the WSMD-induced graph reveals higher-order prototypes that embody the shared diurnal behaviours defining consumer groups, enhancing the interpretability of the resulting clusters.\n  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real Australian smart meter datasets demonstrate that CROCS captures intra-consumer variability, uncovers both synchronous and asynchronous behavioural similarities, and remains robust to anomalies and missing data, while scaling efficiently through natural parallelisation.

      "abstract": "Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.",

To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.",

In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical \"UV-cutoff\" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\\partial θ] \\in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.",

Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.",

Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points.

It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.",

Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.",

Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system.

We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models.

During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality.

      "abstract": "We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.",

      "abstract": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.",

      "abstract": "Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.",

      "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.",

However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.",

Sample generation via gradual denoising or demasking processes allows them to capture hierarchical non-sequential interdependencies in the data. These custom processes, however, do not assume a flexible control over the distribution of generated samples. We propose Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework that allows for controlling the generated distribution of discrete masked diffusion models at inference time. We derive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that, given a trained discrete diffusion model, control the temperature of the sampled distribution (i.e. perform annealing), sample from the product of marginals of several diffusion processes (e.g. differently conditioned processes), and sample from the product of the marginal with an external reward function, producing likely samples from the target distribution that also have high reward. Notably, our framework does not require any training of additional models or fine-tuning of the original model. We illustrate the utility of our framework in several applications including: efficient sampling from the annealed Boltzmann distribution of the Ising model, improving the performance of language models for code generation and amortized learning, as well as reward-tilted protein sequence generation.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.",

To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.",

In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\\% to 89.8\\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI\" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.",

      "abstract": "Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an \"Assistant Axis,\" which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts \"persona drift,\" a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.",

While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.",

      "title": "Online identification of nonlinear time-varying systems with uncertain information",
      "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.",

      "abstract": "Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.",

      "abstract": "Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases.

Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data.

We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.",

      "abstract": "Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.",

We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm.

SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach.

      "abstract": "Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.",

      "abstract": "The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.",

However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \\emph{physics-aware} and \\emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).",

      "abstract": "Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.",

      "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.",

Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.",

However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.",

We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.",

To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

      "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.",

      "abstract": "We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.",

      "abstract": "We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \\footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST",

We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups.

However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure. Extensive experiments over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains compared with conventional SSCC baselines and representative Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes.",

We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces.

This paper proposes a Sim2Real transfer learning framework for per-device CFO calibration, combining simulation-driven pretraining with lightweight receiver adaptation. A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals incorporating parametric hardware distortions (e.g., phase noise, IQ imbalance), enabling generalized feature learning without costly cross-device data collection. Subsequently, only the regression layers are fine-tuned using $1,000$ real frames per target device, preserving hardware-agnostic knowledge while adapting to device-specific impairments. Experiments across three SDR families (USRP B210, USRP N210, HackRF One) achieve $30\\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional CP-based methods under indoor multipath conditions. The framework bridges the simulation-to-reality gap for robust CFO estimation, enabling cost-effective deployment in heterogeneous wireless systems.",

Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \\emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance.

We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset.

However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.",

TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.",

      "abstract": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $σ\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $κ\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4π\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.",

In an online study (N=176), participants completed three professional writing tasks: an email without AI help, a proposal with generic AI suggestions, and a cover letter with persona-based coaching, while half received suggestions tailored to a brief sample of their prior writing. Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points). We distill five design patterns: on-demand initiation, micro-suggestions, voice anchoring, audience scaffolds, and point-of-decision provenance, to guide authorship-preserving writing tools.",

Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.",

Previous studies have shown that LLMs often generate logically inconsistent reasoning steps even when their final answers are correct. These inconsistencies reduce the reliability of step-level reasoning. We propose GeoSteer, a manifold-based framework that improves the quality of intermediate reasoning. The method consists of: (1) constructing a CoT dataset with segment-level scores, (2) training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model and a quality estimation model to learn a low-dimensional manifold of high-quality CoT trajectories, and (3) steering hidden states of target LLMs toward higher-quality regions in the latent space. This update in a latent space behaves like a natural-gradient adjustment in the original hidden-state space. It ensures geometrically coherent steering. We evaluate GeoSteer on the GSM8k dataset using the Qwen3 series. We measure via answer accuracy and overall reasoning performance. GeoSteer improved the exact match accuracy by up to 2.6 points. It also enhanced the pairwise win rate by 5.3 points. These results indicate that GeoSteer provides an effective and controllable mechanism for improving the quality of intermediate reasoning in LLMs.",

Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices. We review first- and second-order optimization techniques in both deterministic and stochastic settings, discuss their adaptation to physics-constrained and data-driven SciML models, and illustrate practical strategies through tutorial examples, while highlighting open research directions at the interface of scientific computing and scientific machine learning.",

      "abstract": "Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.",

We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

      "abstract": "Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

      "abstract": "We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.",

      "abstract": "High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.",

Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.",

Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.",

Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.",

To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively \"tames\" the output length.

Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction.

This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas.

The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR).

      "title": "Credit C-GPT: A Domain-Specialized Large Language Model for Conversational Understanding in Vietnamese Debt Collection",
      "abstract": "Debt collection is a critical function within the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, relying heavily on large-scale human-to-human conversational interactions conducted primarily in Vietnamese contact centers. These conversations involve informal spoken language, emotional variability, and complex domain-specific reasoning, which pose significant challenges for traditional natural language processing systems. This paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a domain-specialized large language model with seven billion parameters, fine-tuned for conversational understanding in Vietnamese debt collection scenarios. The proposed model integrates multiple conversational intelligence tasks, including dialogue understanding, sentiment recognition, intent detection, call stage classification, and structured slot-value extraction, within a single reasoning-based framework. We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets. Experimental results show consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based approaches, indicating that domain-specialized conversational language models provide a scalable and privacy-aware solution for real-time assistance and post-call analytics in enterprise contact centers.",

      "abstract": "Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.",

      "abstract": "Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai",

      "abstract": "Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.",

Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.",

We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.",

We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\\times$ compression at 95.7\\% output fidelity and 32 $\\times$ compression at 95.0\\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2.

MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis.

However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.",

      "abstract": "Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.",

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.",

      "abstract": "Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that \"more context leads to better reasoning\". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.",

      "abstract": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Functional dependencies (FDs) are basic constraints in relational databases and are used for many data management tasks. Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.",

To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.",

      "abstract": "Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

It summarizes the critical technical pathways supporting high-quality role-playing, including psychological scale-driven character modeling, memory-augmented prompting mechanisms, and motivation-situation-based behavioral decision control. At the data level, the paper further analyzes the methods and challenges of constructing role-specific corpora, focusing on data sources, copyright constraints, and structured annotation processes. In terms of evaluation, it collates multi-dimensional assessment frameworks and benchmark datasets covering role knowledge, personality fidelity, value alignment, and interactive hallucination, while commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of methods such as human evaluation, reward models, and LLM-based scoring. Finally, the paper outlines future development directions of role-playing agents, including personality evolution modeling, multi-agent collaborative narrative, multimodal immersive interaction, and integration with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide a systematic perspective and methodological insights for subsequent research.",

Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.",

While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.",

We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure.\n  We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\\%, yielding a mean 57.8\\% reduction in seconds per correct answer. Gains are larger in multilingual repositories, which improve by 17.7\\% in accuracy and 69.5\\% in efficiency on average, compared to 6.6\\% and 46.1\\% in single language repositories.

      "abstract": "Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant \"retrieve-then-prompt\" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.",

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \\textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.",

      "abstract": "As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.",

However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.",

Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.",

Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.",

With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella \"Glass Slipper\" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs \"in the wild\" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.",

We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.",

      "abstract": "Communication in times of crisis is essential. However, there is often a mismatch between the language of governments, aid providers, doctors, and those to whom they are providing aid. Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.",

      "abstract": "Role-playing (RP) agents rely on behavioral profiles to act consistently across diverse narrative contexts, yet existing profiles are largely unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, leading to brittle agent behavior. We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on $85$ characters across $16$ artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.",

      "abstract": "In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, \"I am seeking exaggeration in the essential.\" This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.\n  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.",

The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept.

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows.

      "abstract": "Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\\% of the training data.

Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components.

With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.",

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.",

Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms.

To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text.

Each annotated sentence is converted into an instruction-input-output triple, enabling the model to learn task descriptions while fine-tuning with small low-rank matrices instead of updating all weights.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming astronomical research, yet the scientific community has largely treated this transformation as an engineering challenge rather than an epistemological one. This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what \"understanding\" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will \"derive fundamental physics\" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose \"pragmatic understanding\" as a framework for integration--recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset designed to support patients coping with chronic medical conditions. They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.",

      "abstract": "The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.",

To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.",

Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.",

We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.",

This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.",

However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.",

Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.",

We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.",

However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.",

By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands.

      "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic and expressive facial motions directly from audio. While recent methods achieve high-quality lip synchronization, they often rely on discrete emotion categories, limiting continuous and fine-grained emotional control. We present EditEmoTalk, a controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation framework with continuous emotion editing. The key idea is a boundary-aware semantic embedding that learns the normal directions of inter-emotion decision boundaries, enabling a continuous expression manifold for smooth emotion manipulation. Moreover, we introduce an emotional consistency loss that enforces semantic alignment between the generated motion dynamics and the target emotion embedding through a mapping network, ensuring faithful emotional expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditEmoTalk achieves superior controllability, expressiveness, and generalization while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Code and pretrained models will be released.",

The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations.

      "abstract": "Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \\times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.",

We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust \"safety net,\" repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.",

However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.",

In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.",

However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.",

In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone.

Under the proposed approach, we simulate a \"classroom\" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively.

Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.",

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.",

While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions.

      "abstract": "Android malware has become an increasingly critical threat to organizations, society and individuals, posing significant risks to privacy, data security and infrastructure. As malware continues to evolve in terms of complexity and sophistication, the mitigation and detection of these malicious software instances have become more time consuming and challenging particularly due to the requirement of large number of features to identify potential malware. To address these challenges, this research proposes Fast Gradient Sign Method with Diluted Convolutional Neural Network (FGSM DICNN) method for malware classification. DICNN contains diluted convolutions which increases receptive field, enabling the model to capture dispersed malware patterns across long ranges using fewer features without adding parameters. Additionally, the FGSM strategy enhance the accuracy by using one-step perturbations during training that provides more defensive advantage of lower computational cost. This integration helps to manage high classification accuracy while reducing the dependence on extensive feature sets. The proposed FGSM DICNN model attains 99.44% accuracy while outperforming other existing approaches such as Custom Deep Neural Network (DCNN).",

      "abstract": "Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.",

However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation.",

However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.",

      "abstract": "Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/tmd",

      "abstract": "Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.",

      "abstract": "Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.",

      "abstract": "CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.",

We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy. Our results show consistent improvements over strong neural and LLM baselines, particularly in long-range structural coherence and citation reliability.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by the vision of integrating mobile robots closer to humans in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and the home, we focus on robot navigation in dynamic and spatially constrained environments. Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.",

      "abstract": "Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.",

      "abstract": "Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans.

To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Socially assistive robots hold promise for enhancing therapeutic engagement in paediatric clinical settings. However, their successful implementation requires not only technical robustness but also context-sensitive, co-designed solutions. This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.\n  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.\n  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.\n  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.",

However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.",

      "abstract": "Effective retrieval across both seen and unseen categories is crucial for modern image retrieval systems. Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.",

Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability.

Deep learning has shown strong potential in medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-ray interpretation. This study compares two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated pediatric pneumonia detection. Methods: A publicly available dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images was used. Images were preprocessed through normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization. DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights under identical training settings. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and recall. Model explainability was incorporated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to visualize image regions influencing predictions. Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed DenseNet121, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, F1-score of 0.8899, and MCC of 0.6849. DenseNet121 achieved 79.7% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8597, and MCC of 0.5852. Both models demonstrated high recall values above 0.99, indicating strong sensitivity to pneumonia detection. Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations showed consistent focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the reliability of model decisions. Conclusions: EfficientNet-B0 provided a more balanced and computationally efficient performance compared to DenseNet121, making it a strong candidate for clinical deployment. The integration of explainability techniques enhances transparency and trustworthiness in AI-assisted pediatric pneumonia diagnosis.",

To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.",

A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.",

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.",

To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects.

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.",

      "abstract": "Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.",

Existing NLP frameworks focus on reactively labeling empathy in doctors' responses but offer limited support for anticipatory modeling of empathy needs, especially in general health queries. We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation. EAF provides a framework for identifying empathy needs before response generation, establishes a benchmark for anticipatory empathy modeling, and enables supporting empathetic communication in asynchronous healthcare.",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.",

Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.",

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.",

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.",

      "abstract": "Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.",

      "abstract": "Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.",

Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.",

We create a new silver labelled English dataset, to overcome the lack of manually tagged training data, that we train and evaluate various mono and multilingual neural models in both mono and cross-lingual evaluation setups with comparisons to their rule based counterparts, and show how a rule based system can be enhanced with a neural network model.

We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.",

In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.",

      "abstract": "Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric \"is-a\" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies.",

In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant \"Reasoning Gap\": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\\%.

      "abstract": "Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

      "abstract": "Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.",

Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.",

This paper focuses on the reduction of a foundation's model size when applied to music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. Our research combines the Branchformer architecture with SummaryMixing, which were first applied in speech recognition, along with a random quantization process. To facilitate reproducibility, we conduct pre-training on publicly available datasets, complemented by a proprietary dataset comparable in scale to other private datasets reported in the literature. We ensure robust evaluation by using a framework consisting of a variety of downstream MIR tasks. Our results show that our architecture achieves competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art models that use multi-head self-attention, while reducing the model size from 8.5% up to 12.3%.",

      "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.",

We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.",

It then segments heat source features in the thermal channel to instantly identify high temperature targets and applies this temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map. This approach generates maps that not only have accurate geometry but also possess a critical semantic understanding of the environment, making it highly valuable for specific applications like rapid disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance.",

Given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, the classical task is to decide whether T contains a length-m substring whose Parikh vector equals that of P . While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, where σ = |Σ|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + σ) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated. Our results provide concise, provably correct algorithms with tight bounds, and connect frequency-based string matching to packing-style optimization primitives.",

SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.",

While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data.",

      "abstract": "Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.",

      "abstract": "To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now a common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.",

However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law.",

      "abstract": "The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.",

In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.",

Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving.\n  Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data. We also observe that, with noisy crowd-sourced data, simple regression-based models outperform generative and sequence-based architectures.

      "abstract": "Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.",

      "abstract": "An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.",

      "abstract": "Agile control of robotic systems often requires anticipating how the environment affects system behavior. For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications.",

A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a design methodology of a hydraulically-driven soft robotic gripper for grasping a large and heavy object -- approximately 10 - 20 kg with 20 - 30 cm diameter. Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.",

      "abstract": "Humanoid robot manipulation is a crucial research area for executing diverse human-level tasks, involving high-level semantic reasoning and low-level action generation. However, precise scene understanding and sample-efficient learning from human demonstrations remain critical challenges, severely hindering the applicability and generalizability of existing frameworks. This paper presents a novel RGMP-S, Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy with Spiking features, facilitating both high-level skill reasoning and data-efficient motion synthesis. To ground high-level reasoning in physical reality, we leverage lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases to enable precise 3D scene understanding within the vision-language model. Specifically, we construct a Long-horizon Geometric Prior Skill Selector that effectively aligns the semantic instructions with spatial constraints, ultimately achieving robust generalization in unseen environments. For the data efficiency issue in robotic action generation, we introduce a Recursive Adaptive Spiking Network. We parameterize robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency, fully distilling long-horizon dynamic features while mitigating the overfitting issue in sparse demonstration scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted across the Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems, encompassing a custom-developed humanoid, a desktop manipulator, and a commercial robotic platform. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines and validate the efficacy of the proposed modules in diverse generalization scenarios. To facilitate reproducibility, the source code and video demonstrations are publicly available at https://github.com/xtli12/RGMP-S.git.",

      "abstract": "Complex decision-making by autonomous machines and algorithms could underpin the foundations of future society. Generative AI is emerging as a powerful engine for such transitions. However, we show that Generative AI-driven developments pose a critical pitfall: fairness concerns. In robotic applications, although intuitions about fairness are common, a precise and implementable definition that captures user utility and inherent data randomness is missing. Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets. Addressing fairness concerns in the creative combined consideration of privacy is a step towards ethical use of AI and strengthens trust in autonomous robots deployed in everyday environments.",

We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.",

      "abstract": "VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.",

To enhance robustness against disturbances, modeling uncertainties, and steady-state errors, a passivity-based integral action is incorporated at the torque level without compromising feasibility.

The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws.",

Existing methods have demonstrated agility on parkour courses but often rely on end-to-end sensorimotor models with limited generalization and interpretability. By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments.",

      "abstract": "Constructing an accurate simulation model of real-world environments requires reliable estimation of physical parameters such as mass, geometry, friction, and contact surfaces. Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation.

      "abstract": "The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.",

However, learning through physical engagement can place a heavy burden on users when the process requires large amounts of human-provided data. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands. We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles.

      "abstract": "The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments.",

However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications.",

      "abstract": "Dexterous grasp synthesis remains a central challenge: the high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands prevent direct transfer of algorithms developed for parallel-jaw grippers. Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models.",

To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure.

The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.",

Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring.

      "abstract": "We introduce Fiducial Exoskeletons, an image-based reformulation of 3D robot state estimation that replaces cumbersome procedures and motor-centric pipelines with single-image inference. Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.\n  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.\n  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance. We release code and printable hardware designs to enable further algorithm-hardware co-design.",

      "abstract": "Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.",

To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training. Videos and code are available at https://failure-aware-rl.github.io.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.",

These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data.

This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.",

We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications.",

      "abstract": "This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.",

The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy. This method is applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation. The code is open source and available on GitHub.",

      "abstract": "Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.",

Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and designed with motors enclosed inside to protect them from damage and dirt. Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism. The hand also successfully executed several daily tasks, including closing bottle caps and orienting a pen for writing.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\\SI{100}{\\milli\\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \\textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \\textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\\% to 100\\%).",

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing inherently supports privacy-preserving interaction, making it a promising modality for room-scale HRI. However, existing mmWave-based interaction-sensing systems exhibit poor spatial generalization at unseen distances or viewpoints. To address this challenge, we introduce WaveMan, a spatially adaptive room-scale perception system that restores reliable human interaction sensing across arbitrary user positions. WaveMan integrates viewpoint alignment and spectrogram enhancement for spatial consistency, with dual-channel attention for robust feature extraction. Experiments across five participants show that, under fixed-position evaluation, WaveMan achieves the same cross-position accuracy as the baseline with five times fewer training positions. In random free-position testing, accuracy increases from 33.00% to 94.33%, enabled by the proposed method. These results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable, privacy-preserving interaction for household humanoid robots across unconstrained user positions.",

      "abstract": "When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.",

      "abstract": "6D object pose estimation plays a crucial role in scene understanding for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\\% (compared to 62.5\\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.",

Existing solutions typically resort to training embodiment-specific models, which scales poorly and fails to exploit shared motion semantics. To address this, we present AdaMorph, a unified neural retargeting framework that enables a single model to adapt human motion to diverse robot morphologies. Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration. Experimental results on 12 distinct humanoid robots demonstrate that AdaMorph effectively unifies control across heterogeneous topologies, exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to unseen complex motions while preserving the dynamic essence of the source behaviors.",

This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.",

PALM distills complementary affordance representations that capture object relevance, contact geometry, spatial placements, and motion dynamics, and serve as task-relevant anchors for visuomotor control. To further stabilize long-horizon execution, PALM predicts continuous within-subtask progress, enabling seamless subtask transitions.

      "abstract": "Simulation is crucial in real-world robotics, offering safe, scalable, and efficient environments for developing applications, ranging from humanoid robots to autonomous vehicles and drones. While the Robot Operating System (ROS) has been widely adopted as the backbone of these robotic applications in both academia and industry, its asynchronous, multiprocess design complicates reproducibility, especially across varying hardware platforms. Deterministic callback execution cannot be guaranteed when computation times and communication delays vary. This lack of reproducibility complicates scientific benchmarking and continuous integration, where consistent results are essential. To address this, we present a methodology to create deterministic simulations using ROS 2 nodes. Our ROS Simulation Library for C++ (RSLCPP) implements this approach, enabling existing nodes to be combined into a simulation routine that yields reproducible results without requiring any code changes. We demonstrate that our approach yields identical results across various CPUs and architectures when testing both a synthetic benchmark and a real-world robotics system.

      "abstract": "Development of dexterous robotic joints is essential for advancing manipulation capabilities in robotic systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of a tendon-driven robotic wrist joint together with an efficient Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) for precise motion control. The wrist mechanism is modeled using a Timoshenko-based approach to accurately capture its kinematic and dynamic properties, which serve as the foundation for tendon force calculations within the controller. The proposed SMC is designed to deliver fast dynamic response and computational efficiency, enabling accurate trajectory tracking under varying operating conditions. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through comparative analyses with existing controllers for similar wrist mechanisms. The proposed SMC demonstrates superior performance in both simulation and experimental studies. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in simulation is approximately 1.67e-2 radians, while experimental validation yields an error of 0.2 radians. Additionally, the controller achieves a settling time of less than 3 seconds and a steady-state error below 1e-1 radians, consistently observed across both simulation and experimental evaluations. Comparative analyses confirm that the developed SMC surpasses alternative control strategies in motion accuracy, rapid convergence, and steady-state precision. This work establishes a foundation for future exploration of tendon-driven wrist mechanisms and control strategies in robotic applications.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous high-fidelity object reconstruction is fundamental for creating digital assets and bridging the simulation-to-reality gap in robotics. We present ObjSplat, an active reconstruction framework that leverages Gaussian surfels as a unified representation to progressively reconstruct unknown objects with both photorealistic appearance and accurate geometry. Addressing the limitations of conventional opacity or depth-based cues, we introduce a geometry-aware viewpoint evaluation pipeline that explicitly models back-face visibility and occlusion-aware multi-view covisibility, reliably identifying under-reconstructed regions even on geometrically complex objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of greedy planning strategies, ObjSplat employs a next-best-path (NBP) planner that performs multi-step lookahead on a dynamically constructed spatial graph. By jointly optimizing information gain and movement cost, this planner generates globally efficient trajectories. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real-world cultural artifacts demonstrate that ObjSplat produces physically consistent models within minutes, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and surface completeness while significantly reducing scan time and path length compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.",

This work introduces a novel bearing-box approach that fully leverages modern 3D detection measurements that are widely available nowadays but have not been well explored for motion estimation so far. Unlike existing methods that rely on restrictive assumptions such as isotropic target shape and lateral motion, our bearing-box estimator can estimate both the target's motion and its physical size without these assumptions by exploiting the information buried in a 3D bounding box. When applied to multi-rotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), the estimator yields an interesting advantage: it further removes the need for higher-order motion assumptions by exploiting the unique coupling between MAV's acceleration and thrust. This is particularly significant, as higher-order motion assumptions are widely believed to be necessary in state-of-the-art bearing-based estimators. We support our claims with rigorous observability analyses and extensive experimental validation, demonstrating the estimator's superior performance in real-world scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel family of single-track vehicle models that incorporate a distributed representation of transient tyre dynamics, whilst simultaneously accounting for nonlinear effects induced by friction. The core of the proposed framework is represented by the distributed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) model, which unifies and extends classical formulations such as Dahl and LuGre by describing the rolling contact process as a spatially distributed system governed by semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This model is systematically integrated into a single-track vehicle framework, where the resulting semilinear ODE-PDE interconnection captures the interaction between lateral vehicle motion and tyre deformation. Two main variants are considered: one with rigid tyre carcass and another with flexible carcass, each admitting a compact state-space representation. Local and global well-posedness properties for the coupled system are established rigorously, highlighting the dissipative and physically consistent properties of the distributed FrBD model. A linearisation procedure is also presented, enabling spectral analysis and transfer function derivation, and potentially facilitating the synthesis of controllers and observers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to capture micro-shimmy oscillations and transient lateral responses to advanced steering manoeuvres. The proposed formulation advances the state-of-the-art in vehicle dynamics modelling by providing a physically grounded, mathematically rigorous, and computationally tractable approach to incorporating transient tyre behaviour in lateral vehicle dynamics, when accounting for the effect of limited friction.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a single-actuator passive gripper that achieves both stable grasping and continuous bidirectional in-hand rotation through mechanically encoded power transmission logic. Unlike conventional multifunctional grippers that require multiple actuators, sensors, or control-based switching, the proposed gripper transitions between grasping and rotation solely according to the magnitude of the applied input torque. The key enabler of this behavior is a Twisted Underactuated Mechanism (TUM), which generates non-coplanar motions, namely axial contraction and rotation, from a single rotational input while producing identical contraction regardless of rotation direction. A friction generator mechanically defines torque thresholds that govern passive mode switching, enabling stable grasp establishment before autonomously transitioning to in-hand rotation without sensing or active control. Analytical models describing the kinematics, elastic force generation, and torque transmission of the TUM are derived and experimentally validated. The fabricated gripper is evaluated through quantitative experiments on grasp success, friction-based grasp force regulation, and bidirectional rotation performance. System-level demonstrations, including bolt manipulation, object reorientation, and manipulator-integrated tasks driven solely by wrist torque, confirm reliable grasp to rotate transitions in both rotational directions. These results demonstrate that non-coplanar multifunctional manipulation can be realized through mechanical design alone, establishing mechanically encoded power transmission logic as a robust alternative to actuator and control intensive gripper architectures.",

To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Such results highlight the importance of global spatial representations for generalizable navigation.",

Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.",

Our algorithm integrates a Social LSTM model with attention mechanisms to predict the trajectories of failing drones and compute near-optimal evacuation paths that minimize the likelihood of surviving drones being hit by fallen drones. In the recovery node, our system deploys hidden drones (operating with their LED lights turned off) to replace failed drones so that the drone light show can continue.

Our method combines local perceptual inputs with frontier-based exploration and periodic LLM queries, which extract symbolic patterns (e.g., room numbering schemes and building layout structures) and update a confidence grid used to guide exploration. This enables robots to move efficiently toward goal locations labeled with textual identifiers (e.g., \"room 8\") even before direct observation. We demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient navigation in sparse, partially observable grid environments by exploiting symbolic patterns. Experiments across environments modeled after real floor plans show that our approach consistently achieves near-optimal paths and outperforms baselines by over 25% in Success weighted by Path Length.",
