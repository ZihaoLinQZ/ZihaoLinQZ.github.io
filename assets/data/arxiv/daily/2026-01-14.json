      "title": "RAVEN: Erasing Invisible Watermarks via Novel View Synthesis",
      "abstract": "Invisible watermarking has become a critical mechanism for authenticating AI-generated image content, with major platforms deploying watermarking schemes at scale. However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.",

      "title": "3AM: Segment Anything with Geometric Consistency in Videos",
      "abstract": "Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of recommender systems has shifted preference storage from rating matrices and dense embeddings to semantic memory in the agentic era. Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

      "abstract": "The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.",

      "abstract": "Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.

Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.",

We evaluated eight frontier models on APEX-SWE. Gemini 3 Pro (Thinking = High) performs best, with a Pass@1 score of 25\\%. Our analysis shows that strong performance is primarily driven by epistemic reasoning, defined as the ability to distinguish between assumptions and verified facts, combined with agency to resolve uncertainty prior to acting.

We evaluate state-of-the-art computer-vision methods for photographic re-identification of the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) using 1,233 ventral images from 191 individuals collected during 2013-2020 capture-recapture surveys. We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses. Overall, in this species, zero-shot deep local-feature matching outperformed global-feature embedding and provides a strong default for photo-identification.",

Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks.

      "abstract": "The rapid emergence of image synthesis models poses challenges to the generalization of AI-generated image detectors. However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators.",

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in digital platforms and decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.",

      "title": "On the use of graph models to achieve individual and group fairness",
      "abstract": "Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts such as justice, healthcare and finance, which has spawned a great demand for fairness in these procedures. However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs.",

In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

      "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.",

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.\n  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.",

But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose \"thick entertainment\" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about \"intelligence\" as social media is about social connection.",

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.",

In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in natural language processing highlight text as an emerging data source for ecology. Textual resources carry unique information that can be used in complementarity with geospatial data sources, thus providing insights at the local scale into environmental conditions and properties hidden from more traditional data sources. Leveraging textual information in a spatial context presents several challenges. First, the contribution of textual data remains poorly defined in an ecological context, and it is unclear for which tasks it should be incorporated. Unlike ubiquitous satellite imagery or environmental covariates, the availability of textual data is sparse and irregular; its integration with geospatial data is not straightforward. In response to these challenges, this work proposes an attention-based approach that combines aerial imagery and geolocated text within a spatial neighbourhood, i.e. integrating contributions from several nearby observations. Our approach combines vision and text representations with a geolocation encoding, with an attention-based module that dynamically selects spatial neighbours that are useful for predictive tasks.The proposed approach is applied to the EcoWikiRS dataset, which combines high-resolution aerial imagery with sentences extracted from Wikipedia describing local environmental conditions across Switzerland. Our model is evaluated on the task of predicting 103 environmental variables from the SWECO25 data cube. Our approach consistently outperforms single-location or unimodal, i.e. image-only or text-only, baselines. When analysing variables by thematic groups, results show a significant improvement in performance for climatic, edaphic, population and land use/land cover variables, underscoring the benefit of including the spatial context when combining text and image data.",

This indiscriminate approach not only incurs unnecessary computational costs but also degrades performance by saturating the context with irrelevant noise. To address these limitations, we introduce Agentic Context Evolution (ACE), a framework inspired by human metacognition that dynamically determines whether to seek new evidence or reason with existing knowledge. ACE employs a central orchestrator agent to make decisions strategically via majority voting.It aims to alternate between activating a retriever agent for external retrieval and a reasoner agent for internal analysis and refinement. By eliminating redundant retrieval steps, ACE maintains a concise and evolved context. Extensive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in accuracy while achieving efficient token consumption.Our work provides valuable insights into advancing context-evolved generation for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.",

      "abstract": "In Text-to-SQL tasks, existing LLM-based methods often include extensive database schemas in prompts, leading to long context lengths and increased prefilling latency. While user queries typically focus on recurrent table sets-offering an opportunity for KV cache sharing across queries-current inference engines, such as SGLang and vLLM, generate redundant prefix cache copies when processing user queries with varying table orders. To address this inefficiency, we propose precomputing table representations as KV caches offline and querying the required ones online. A key aspect of our approach is the computation of table caches while preserving primary foreign key relationships between tables. Additionally, we construct a Table Trie structure to facilitate efficient KV cache lookups during inference. To enhance cache performance, we introduce a cache management system with a query reranking strategy to improve cache hit rates and a computation loading pipeline for parallelizing model inference and cache loading. Experimental results show that our proposed TableCache achieves up to a 3.62x speedup in Time to First Token (TTFT) with negligible performance degradation.",

      "abstract": "Attributional inference, the ability to predict latent intentions behind observed actions, is a critical yet underexplored capability for large language models (LLMs) operating in multi-agent environments. Traditional natural language inference (NLI), in fact, fails to capture the nuanced, intention-driven reasoning essential for complex interactive systems. To address this gap, we introduce Attributional NLI (Att-NLI), a framework that extends NLI with principles from social psychology to assess an agent's capacity for abductive intentional inference (generating hypotheses about latent intentions), and subsequent deductive verification (drawing valid logical conclusions). We instantiate Att-NLI via a textual game, Undercover-V, experimenting with three types of LLM agents with varying reasoning capabilities and access to external tools: a standard NLI agent using only deductive inference, an Att-NLI agent employing abductive-deductive inference, and a neuro-symbolic Att-NLI agent performing abductive-deductive inference with external theorem provers. Extensive experiments demonstrate a clear hierarchy of attributional inference capabilities, with neuro-symbolic agents consistently outperforming others, achieving an average win rate of 17.08%. Our results underscore the role that Att-NLI can play in developing agents with sophisticated reasoning capabilities, highlighting, at the same time, the potential impact of neuro-symbolic AI in building rational LLM agents acting in multi-agent environments.",

To address these challenges, we present From Rows to Reasoning (FRTR), an advanced, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that decomposes Excel workbooks into granular row, column, and block embeddings, employs hybrid lexical-dense retrieval with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and integrates multimodal embeddings to reason over both numerical and visual information. We tested FRTR on six LLMs, achieving 74% answer accuracy on FRTR-Bench with Claude Sonnet 4.5, a substantial improvement over prior state-of-the-art approaches that reached only 24%.

However, many practical KGs are private, and sending retrieved triples or exploration traces to closed-source LLM APIs introduces leakage risk. Existing privacy treatments focus on masking entity names, but they still face four limitations: structural leakage under semantic masking, uncontrollable remote interaction, fragile multi-hop and multi-entity reasoning, and limited experience reuse for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose PrivGemo, a privacy-preserving retrieval-augmented framework for KG-grounded reasoning with memory-guided exposure control. PrivGemo uses a dual-tower design to keep raw KG knowledge local while enabling remote reasoning over an anonymized view that goes beyond name masking to limit both semantic and structural exposure. PrivGemo supports multi-hop, multi-entity reasoning by retrieving anonymized long-hop paths that connect all topic entities, while keeping grounding and verification on the local KG. A hierarchical controller and a privacy-aware experience memory further reduce unnecessary exploration and remote interactions. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmarks show that PrivGemo achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 17.1%. Furthermore, PrivGemo enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.",

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.",

Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework. We further investigated unsupervised domain adaptation to improve generalization to an external clinical dataset. ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set.

We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a central optimisation framework in machine learning. Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems.",

      "abstract": "While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\\cos(\\bmω^{\\top}Δ\\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_i,\\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy.",

      "abstract": "A multi-preconditioned LBFGS (MP-LBFGS) algorithm is introduced for training finite-basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs). The algorithm is motivated by the nonlinear additive Schwarz method and exploits the domain-decomposition-inspired additive architecture of FBPINNs, in which local neural networks are defined on subdomains, thereby localizing the network representation. Parallel, subdomain-local quasi-Newton corrections are then constructed on the corresponding local parts of the architecture. A key feature is a novel nonlinear multi-preconditioning mechanism, in which subdomain corrections are optimally combined through the solution of a low-dimensional subspace minimization problem. Numerical experiments indicate that MP-LBFGS can improve convergence speed, as well as model accuracy over standard LBFGS while incurring lower communication overhead.",

      "abstract": "Multi-behavior recommendation faces a critical challenge in practice: auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, carts) are often noisy, weakly correlated, or semantically misaligned with the target behavior (e.g., purchase), which leads to biased preference learning and suboptimal performance. While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.\n  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations. For reproducibility, our code is available at https://github.com/miaomiao-cai2/RMBRec/.",

      "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is concerned with producing explanations indicating the inner workings of models. For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper \"Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth\", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method \"AXE\" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and generalisable segmentation of stroke lesions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for advancing clinical research, prognostic modelling, and personalised interventions. Although deep learning has improved automated lesion delineation, many existing models are optimised for narrow imaging contexts and generalise poorly to independent datasets, modalities, and stroke stages. Here, we systematically evaluated stroke lesion segmentation using the nnU-Net framework across multiple heterogeneous, publicly available MRI datasets spanning acute and chronic stroke. Models were trained and tested on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T1-weighted MRI, and evaluated on independent datasets. Across stroke stages, models showed robust generalisation, with segmentation accuracy approaching reported inter-rater reliability. Performance varied with imaging modality and training data characteristics. In acute stroke, DWI-trained models consistently outperformed FLAIR-based models, with only modest gains from multimodal combinations. In chronic stroke, increasing training set size improved performance, with diminishing returns beyond several hundred cases. Lesion volume was a key determinant of accuracy: smaller lesions were harder to segment, and models trained on restricted volume ranges generalised poorly. MRI image quality further constrained generalisability: models trained on lower-quality scans transferred poorly, whereas those trained on higher-quality data generalised well to noisier images. Discrepancies between predictions and reference masks were often attributable to limitations in manual annotations. Together, these findings show that automated lesion segmentation can approach human-level performance while identifying key factors governing generalisability and informing the development of lesion segmentation tools.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGShaper, a novel data synthesis framework designed to automate the construction of RAG tasks and robust agent trajectories. RAGShaper incorporates an InfoCurator to build dense information trees enriched with adversarial distractors spanning Perception and Cognition levels. Furthermore, we propose a constrained navigation strategy that forces a teacher agent to confront these distractors, thereby eliciting trajectories that explicitly demonstrate error correction and noise rejection. Comprehensive experiments confirm that models trained on our synthesized corpus significantly outperform existing baselines, exhibiting superior robustness in noise-intensive and complex retrieval tasks.",

The second survey, informed by the first, explores how AI systems could be designed to address these concerns through open-ended questions.

In contrast, decades of work in metaheuristics have shown that maintaining and evolving populations of solutions improves robustness and exploration, and often leads to stronger performance. To close this gap, we study how to make NCO explicitly population-based by learning policies that act on sets of candidate solutions. We first propose a simple taxonomy of population awareness levels and use it to highlight two key design challenges: (i) how to represent a whole population inside a neural network, and (ii) how to learn population dynamics that balance intensification (generating good solutions) and diversification (maintaining variety). We make these ideas concrete with two complementary tools: one that improves existing solutions using information shared across the whole population, and the other generates new candidate solutions that explicitly balance being high-quality with diversity. Experimental results on Maximum Cut and Maximum Independent Set indicate that incorporating population structure is advantageous for learned optimization methods and opens new connections between NCO and classical population-based search.",

Conventional neural models learn statistical correspondences between names and nationalities from task-specific training data, posing challenges in generalizing to low-frequency nationalities and distinguishing similar nationalities within the same region. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address these challenges by leveraging world knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this study, we comprehensively compare neural models and LLMs on nationality prediction, evaluating six neural models and six LLM prompting strategies across three granularity levels (nationality, region, and continent), with frequency-based stratified analysis and error analysis. Results show that LLMs outperform neural models at all granularity levels, with the gap narrowing as granularity becomes coarser. Simple machine learning methods exhibit the highest frequency robustness, while pre-trained models and LLMs show degradation for low-frequency nationalities. Error analysis reveals that LLMs tend to make ``near-miss'' errors, predicting the correct region even when nationality is incorrect, whereas neural models exhibit more cross-regional errors and bias toward high-frequency classes. These findings indicate that LLM superiority stems from world knowledge, model selection should consider required granularity, and evaluation should account for error quality beyond accuracy.",

We evaluate some state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe substantial gaps to human experts, particularly in reasoning and strategy coding.

This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are essential for evaluating corporate sustainability and ethical performance. However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.",

      "abstract": "Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.",

Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated \"experts\", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior.

In this study, we systematically investigate false refusal behavior in hate speech detoxification and analyze the contextual and linguistic biases that trigger such refusals. We evaluate nine LLMs on both English and multilingual datasets, our results show that LLMs disproportionately refuse inputs with higher semantic toxicity and those targeting specific groups, particularly nationality, religion, and political ideology. Although multilingual datasets exhibit lower overall false refusal rates than English datasets, models still display systematic, language-dependent biases toward certain targets. Based on these findings, we propose a simple cross-translation strategy, translating English hate speech into Chinese for detoxification and back, which substantially reduces false refusals while preserving the original content, providing an effective and lightweight mitigation approach.",

      "abstract": "Aims: This study investigates whether a U-Net architecture can perform standalone end-to-end blind deconvolution of astronomical images without any prior knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) or noise characteristics. Our goal is to evaluate its performance against the number of training images, classical Tikhonov deconvolution and to assess its generalization capability under varying seeing conditions and noise levels.\n  Methods: Realistic astronomical observations are simulated using the GalSim toolkit, incorporating random transformations, PSF convolution (accounting for both optical and atmospheric effects), and Gaussian white noise. A U-Net model is trained using a Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function on datasets of varying sizes, up to 40,000 images of size 48x48 from the COSMOS Real Galaxy Dataset. Performance is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity metrics, with the latter employed in a two-model framework to assess solution stability.\n  Results: The U-Net model demonstrates effectiveness in blind deconvolution, with performance improving consistently as the training dataset size increases, saturating beyond 5,000 images. Cosine similarity analysis reveals convergence between independently trained models, indicating stable solutions. Remarkably, the U-Net outperforms the oracle-like Tikhonov method in challenging conditions (low PSNR/medium SSIM). The model also generalizes well to unseen seeing and noise conditions, although optimal performance is achieved when training parameters include validation conditions. Experiments on synthetic $C^α$ images further support the hypothesis that the U-Net learns a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis, akin to sparse representations observed in denoising tasks. These results align with recent mathematical insights into its adaptive learning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.",

The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations.

We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%.

The dataset, containing 34 languages and over ten thousand items, allows comparative analyses of idiomatic patterns among language-specific realisations and preferences in order to gather insights about shared cultural aspects. This parallel dataset allows to evaluate model performance for a given PIE in different languages and whether idiomatic understanding in one language can be transferred to another. Moreover, the dataset supports the study of PIEs across textual and visual modalities, to measure to what extent PIE understanding in one modality transfers or implies in understanding in another modality (text vs. image). The data was created by language experts, with both textual and visual components crafted under multilingual guidelines, and each PIE is accompanied by five images representing a spectrum from idiomatic to literal meanings, including semantically related and random distractors. The result is a high-quality benchmark for evaluating multilingual and multimodal idiomatic language understanding.",

      "abstract": "The launch of \\$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \\$500,000 across these projects.",

      "abstract": "While recent research has systematically documented political orientation in large language models (LLMs), existing evaluations rely primarily on direct probing or demographic persona engineering to surface ideological biases. In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.",

      "abstract": "Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.",

      "abstract": "Data curation is a critical yet under-researched step in the machine translation training paradigm. To train translation systems, data acquisition relies primarily on human translations and digital parallel sources or, to a limited degree, synthetic generation. But, for low-resource languages, human translation to generate sufficient data is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a framework that screens source sentences to form efficient parallel text, ensuring optimal MT system performance in low-resource environments. We approach this by evaluating English-Hindi bi-text to determine effective sentence selection strategies for optimal MT system training. Our extensively tested framework, (Lexical And Linguistically Informed Text Analysis) LALITA, targets source sentence selection using lexical and linguistic features to curate parallel corpora. We find that by training mostly on complex sentences from both existing and synthetic datasets, our method significantly improves translation quality. We test this by simulating low-resource data availabilty with curated datasets of 50K to 800K English sentences and report improved performances on all data sizes. LALITA demonstrates remarkable efficiency, reducing data needs by more than half across multiple languages (Hindi, Odia, Nepali, Norwegian Nynorsk, and German). This approach not only reduces MT systems training cost by reducing training data requirement, but also showcases LALITA's utility in data augmentation.",

We further propose a diagnostic framework that evaluates models beyond recovery accuracy, including semantic fidelity, logical validity, consistency, robustness sensitivity, and information density. Experiments on twelve widely used LLMs show that structural reconstruction remains difficult even for frontier systems: zero-shot recovery frequently falls below 35%. We also observe a consistent dissociation between semantic recall and structural planning, suggesting that structural robustness is not an automatic byproduct of semantic competence.",

      "abstract": "Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in search-augmented large reasoning models (LRMs) enable the retrieval of external knowledge to reduce hallucinations in multistep reasoning. However, their ability to operate on graph-structured data, prevalent in domains such as e-commerce, social networks, and scientific citations, remains underexplored. Unlike plain text corpora, graphs encode rich topological signals that connect related entities and can serve as valuable priors for retrieval, enabling more targeted search and improved reasoning efficiency. Yet, effectively leveraging such structure poses unique challenges, including the difficulty of generating graph-expressive queries and ensuring reliable retrieval that balances structural and semantic relevance. To address this gap, we introduce GraphSearch, the first framework that extends search-augmented reasoning to graph learning, enabling zero-shot graph learning without task-specific fine-tuning. GraphSearch combines a Graph-aware Query Planner, which disentangles search space (e.g., 1-hop, multi-hop, or global neighbors) from semantic queries, with a Graph-aware Retriever, which constructs candidate sets based on topology and ranks them using a hybrid scoring function. We further instantiate two traversal modes: GraphSearch-R, which recursively expands neighborhoods hop by hop, and GraphSearch-F, which flexibly retrieves across local and global neighborhoods without hop constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GraphSearch achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to supervised graph learning methods, setting state-of-the-art results in zero-shot node classification and link prediction. These findings position GraphSearch as a flexible and generalizable paradigm for agentic reasoning over graphs.",

Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition. Exploiting the fact that the pairwise loss depends only on differences of linear predictors, we simplify computation and analysis. We establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, showing that under suitable regularity conditions, leading to linear convergence up to the minimax-optimal statistical precision. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in challenging settings such as label switching and data contamination and consistently outperforms likelihood-based approaches.",

Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches. Across a comprehensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that SoC consistently improves calibration performance, while also maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities.",

However, existing SFDA approaches struggle with the trade-off between perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA.

      "abstract": "Experience intervention in web agents emerges as a promising technical paradigm, enhancing agent interaction capabilities by providing valuable insights from accumulated experiences. However, existing methods predominantly inject experience passively as global context before task execution, struggling to adapt to dynamically changing contextual observations during agent-environment interaction. We propose ExpSeek, which shifts experience toward step-level proactive seeking: (1) estimating step-level entropy thresholds to determine intervention timing using the model's intrinsic signals; (2) designing step-level tailor-designed experience content. Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Our experiments validate the feasibility and advantages of entropy as a self-triggering signal, reveal that even a 4B small-scale experience model can significantly boost the performance of larger agent models.",

      "title": "Interpretability and Individuality in Knee MRI: Patient-Specific Radiomic Fingerprint with Reconstructed Healthy Personas",
      "abstract": "For automated assessment of knee MRI scans, both accuracy and interpretability are essential for clinical use and adoption. Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation.",

      "abstract": "Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.",

      "abstract": "Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

Even simple edits often demand expertise, time, and careful planning, constraining how creators envision and shape their narratives. Recent advances in generative AI suggest a new paradigm: what if editing a video were as straightforward as rewriting text? To investigate this, we present a tech probe and a study on text-driven video reauthoring. Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm. Our work contributes empirical insights into the opportunities and challenges of text-driven video reauthoring, offering design implications for future co-creative video tools.",

This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts. The study demonstrates the potential of this AI assistant to support informed, timely decision-making and strengthen water security in complex river basins.",

      "abstract": "Incomplete point clouds captured by 3D sensors often result in the loss of both geometric and semantic information. Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment.

We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration.

Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that EviNAM matches state-of-the-art predictive performance. While we focus on regression, our method extends naturally to classification and generalized additive models, offering a path toward more intelligible and trustworthy predictions.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a two-stage multitask learning framework for analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning. In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.",

In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios.

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of AI has fueled the expansion of accelerator- or GPU-based data centers. However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown). We further investigate the effect of data and tensor parallelism, and show our discovered clock frequencies translate well for both. We conclude that kernel-level DVFS is a suitable technique to reduce waste in LLM operations, providing significant energy savings with negligible slow-down.",

However, how to rigorously evaluate these systems remains under-explored. Existing deep-research benchmarks often fall into two failure modes. Some do not adequately test a system's ability to analyze evidence and write coherent reports. Others rely on evaluation criteria that are either overly coarse or directly defined by LLMs (or both), leading to scores that can be biased relative to human experts and are hard to verify or interpret. To address these issues, we introduce Deep Research Bench II, a new benchmark for evaluating DRS-generated reports. It contains 132 grounded research tasks across 22 domains; for each task, a system must produce a long-form research report that is evaluated by a set of 9430 fine-grained binary rubrics in total, covering three dimensions: information recall, analysis, and presentation. All rubrics are derived from carefully selected expert-written investigative articles and are constructed through a four-stage LLM+human pipeline that combines automatic extraction with over 400 human-hours of expert review, ensuring that the criteria are atomic, verifiable, and aligned with human expert judgment. We evaluate several state-of-the-art deep-research systems on Deep Research Bench II and find that even the strongest models satisfy fewer than 50% of the rubrics, revealing a substantial gap between current DRSs and human experts.",

      "abstract": "Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.",

The proposed learning rule preserves strict synaptic locality, admits linear-time complexity, and enables efficient supervised learning without backpropagation, surrogate gradients, or teacher forcing.\n  We integrate supervised SADP within hybrid CNN-SNN architectures, where convolutional encoders provide compact feature representations that are converted into Poisson spike trains for agreement-driven learning in the SNN. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and biomedical image classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance and fast convergence. Additional analyses show stable performance across broad hyperparameter ranges and compatibility with device-inspired synaptic update dynamics.

To enhance robustness against disturbances, modeling uncertainties, and steady-state errors, a passivity-based integral action is incorporated at the torque level without compromising feasibility.

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.\n  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.",

We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Our analysis confirms that the LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing this method from random search and highlighting the immense potential of language-driven design in deep learning.",

The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws.",

      "abstract": "The distinction between conditional, unconditional, and absolute convergence in infinite-dimensional spaces has fundamental implications for computational algorithms. While these concepts coincide in finite dimensions, the Dvoretzky-Rogers theorem establishes their strict separation in general Banach spaces. We present a comprehensive characterization theorem unifying seven equivalent conditions for unconditional convergence: permutation invariance, net convergence, subseries tests, sign stability, bounded multiplier properties, and weak uniform convergence. These theoretical results directly inform algorithmic stability analysis, governing permutation invariance in gradient accumulation for Stochastic Gradient Descent and justifying coefficient thresholding in frame-based signal processing. Our work bridges classical functional analysis with contemporary computational practice, providing rigorous foundations for order-independent and numerically robust summation processes.",

      "abstract": "Recent LLMs increasingly integrate reasoning mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this explicit reasoning exposes a new attack surface for inference-time backdoors, which inject malicious reasoning paths without altering model parameters. Because these attacks generate linguistically coherent paths, they effectively evade conventional detection. To address this, we propose STAR (State-Transition Amplification Ratio), a framework that detects backdoors by analyzing output probability shifts. STAR exploits the statistical discrepancy where a malicious input-induced path exhibits high posterior probability despite a low prior probability in the model's general knowledge. We quantify this state-transition amplification and employ the CUSUM algorithm to detect persistent anomalies. Experiments across diverse models (8B-70B) and five benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR exhibits robust generalization capabilities, consistently achieving near-perfect performance (AUROC $\\approx$ 1.0) with approximately $42\\times$ greater efficiency than existing baselines. Furthermore, the framework proves robust against adaptive attacks attempting to bypass detection.",

In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios.

We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.",

      "abstract": "Despite the recent advancements in NLP with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), Entity Linking (EL) for historical texts remains challenging due to linguistic variation, noisy inputs, and evolving semantic conventions. Existing solutions either require substantial training data or rely on domain-specific rules that limit scalability. In this paper, we present MHEL-LLaMo (Multilingual Historical Entity Linking with Large Language MOdels), an unsupervised ensemble approach combining a Small Language Model (SLM) and an LLM. MHEL-LLaMo leverages a multilingual bi-encoder (BELA) for candidate retrieval and an instruction-tuned LLM for NIL prediction and candidate selection via prompt chaining. Our system uses SLM's confidence scores to discriminate between easy and hard samples, applying an LLM only for hard cases. This strategy reduces computational costs while preventing hallucinations on straightforward cases. We evaluate MHEL-LLaMo on four established benchmarks in six European languages (English, Finnish, French, German, Italian and Swedish) from the 19th and 20th centuries. Results demonstrate that MHEL-LLaMo outperforms state-of-the-art models without requiring fine-tuning, offering a scalable solution for low-resource historical EL. The implementation of MHEL-LLaMo is available on Github.",

However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance.",

While activation steering can modulate refusal, ablating the raw \"refusal vector\" calculated from contrastive harmful and harmless prompts often causes collateral damage and distribution drift. We argue this degradation occurs because the raw vector is polysemantic, entangling the refusal signal with core capability circuits and linguistic style.\n  We introduce Surgical Refusal Ablation (SRA) to distill these steering directions. SRA constructs a registry of independent Concept Atoms representing protected capabilities and stylistic confounds, then uses ridge-regularized spectral residualization to orthogonalize the refusal vector against these directions. This yields a clean refusal direction that targets refusal-relevant structure while minimizing disruption to the model's semantic geometry.\n  Across five models (Qwen3-VL and Ministral series), SRA achieves deep refusal reduction (0-2%) with negligible perplexity impact on Wikitext-2 (mean delta PPL approx. 0.02) and minimal distribution drift. Notably, standard ablation on Qwen3-VL-4B induces severe drift (first-token KL = 2.088), whereas SRA maintains the original distribution (KL = 0.044) while achieving the same 0% refusal rate. Using teacher-forced perplexity on GSM8K and MBPP as a high-resolution capability proxy, we show SRA preserves math and code distributions. These results suggest that common \"model damage\" is often \"Ghost Noise,\" defined as the spectral bleeding of the dirty refusal direction into capability subspaces.",

By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments.",

      "abstract": "Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.",

In particular, empathy is a key non-functional requirement in therapeutic contexts, yet current chatbot development practices provide no systematic means to specify or verify it. This paper envisions a framework integrating natural language processing and formal verification to deliver empathetic therapy chatbots. A Transformer-based model extracts dialogue features, which are then translated into a Stochastic Hybrid Automaton model of dyadic therapy sessions. Empathy-related properties can then be verified through Statistical Model Checking, while strategy synthesis provides guidance for shaping agent behavior. Preliminary results show that the formal model captures therapy dynamics with good fidelity and that ad-hoc strategies improve the probability of satisfying empathy requirements.",

      "abstract": "Reliable zero-shot detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for deploying vision-language models in open-world settings. However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC by 1.33% and reducing FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines.",

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{HazardForge}, a scalable pipeline that leverages image editing models to generate these scenarios with layout decision algorithms, and validation modules. Using HazardForge, we construct \\textbf{MovSafeBench}, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmark comprising 7,254 images and corresponding QA pairs across 13 object categories, covering both normal and anomalous objects.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization.",

We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.",

To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.",

We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel.

However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation. This design effectively excludes the degraded modality and corrects the predictions using high-quality queries. Moreover, the decoupled framework allows us to optimize each individual branch with unpaired RGB or TIR images, eliminating the need for paired RGB-T data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers superior performance to existing RGB-T detectors and achieves better modality independence.",

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space.

      "abstract": "Objectives: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with extensive peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings.",

This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models. The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction.",

We investigate decoding order through masked diffusion framework, which progressively unmasks positions and allows arbitrary decoding orders during training and inference. By interpolating between identity and random permutations, we show that randomness in decoding order affects speech quality. We further compare fixed strategies, such as \\texttt{l2r} and \\texttt{r2l} with adaptive ones, such as Top-$K$, finding that fixed-order decoding, including the dominating left-to-right approach, is suboptimal, while adaptive decoding yields better performance. Finally, since masked diffusion requires discrete inputs, we quantise acoustic representations and find that even 1-bit quantisation can support reasonably high-quality speech.",

To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors.",

      "abstract": "The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.",

Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue.

      "abstract": "Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \\textit{reference-free} method that learns \\textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation.

Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available.",

Second, we devise Evidence-Anchored Reward Attribution to redistribute global rewards by anchoring credit to key memory operations, based on the specific memory items utilized as evidence in reasoning. Together, these components enable stable policy optimization and align local memory operations with the long-term utility of memory. Experiments on Memalpha and MemoryAgentBench demonstrate that Fine-Mem consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving superior success rates across various sub-tasks.

However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task.

While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion.",

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework, Multimodal Language-Guided Network (MMLGNet), to align heterogeneous remote sensing modalities like Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and LiDAR with natural language semantics using vision-language models such as CLIP. With the increasing availability of multimodal Earth observation data, there is a growing need for methods that effectively fuse spectral, spatial, and geometric information while enabling semantic-level understanding. MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation. Notably, MMLGNet achieves strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, outperforming several established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant benefit of language supervision.

      "abstract": "Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.",

Existing methods struggle with multi-view fusion, camera extrinsic uncertainty, and scalability for large camera setups. We propose SPARK, a self-calibrating real-time multi-camera point cloud reconstruction framework that jointly handles point cloud fusion and extrinsic uncertainty. SPARK consists of: (1) a geometry-aware online extrinsic estimation module leveraging multi-view priors and enforcing cross-view and temporal consistency for stable self-calibration, and (2) a confidence-driven point cloud fusion strategy modeling depth reliability and visibility at pixel and point levels to suppress noise and view-dependent inconsistencies. By performing frame-wise fusion without accumulation, SPARK produces stable point clouds in dynamic scenes while scaling linearly with the number of cameras. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-camera systems show that SPARK outperforms existing approaches in extrinsic accuracy, geometric consistency, temporal stability, and real-time performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for large-scale multi-camera 3D reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs",

However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.",

This approach enables users to interact with simulated drones through prompts or command descriptions, allowing them to easily access and control the drone's status, significantly lowering the operational threshold. In the AirSim simulator, we can flexibly construct visually realistic dynamic environments to simulate drone applications in complex scenarios. By combining a large dataset of (natural language, program code) command-execution pairs generated by ChatGPT with developer-written drone code as training data, we fine-tune the CodeT5 to achieve automated translation from natural language to executable code for drone tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior task execution efficiency and command understanding capabilities in simulated environments. In the future, we plan to extend the model functionality in a modular manner, enhancing its adaptability to complex scenarios and driving the application of drone technologies in real-world environments.",

      "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a central tool for modeling the dynamics of physical, engineering, and materials systems, but high-fidelity simulations are often computationally expensive. At the same time, many scientific applications can be viewed as the evolution of spatially distributed fields, making data-driven forecasting of such fields a core task in scientific machine learning. In this work we study autoregressive deep-learning surrogates for two-dimensional PDE dynamics on periodic domains, focusing on generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions within a fixed PDE and parameter regime and on strict small-data settings with at most $\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ simulated trajectories per system. We introduce a multi-channel U-Net [...], evaluate it on five qualitatively different PDE families and compare it to ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, and KAN-UNet under a common training setup. Across all datasets, me-UNet matches or outperforms these more complex architectures in terms of field-space error, spectral similarity, and physics-based metrics for in-distribution rollouts, while requiring substantially less training time. It also generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as $\\approx 20$ training simulations. A data-efficiency study and Grad-CAM analysis further suggest that, in small-data periodic 2D PDE settings, convolutional architectures with inductive biases aligned to locality and periodic boundary conditions remain strong contenders for accurate and moderately out-of-distribution-robust surrogate modeling.",

This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance.

We simulate student-teacher conversations and use our framework to let the LLM tutor adjust its strategy to the simulated student personality. We evaluate the scenario with human teachers and find that they consistently prefer our approach over two baselines.

Methods: A two-stage deep learning pipeline was implemented.

Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis. Radiologists reported 84% alignment between Grad-CAM and their diagnostic impressions, supporting the radiographic relevance of the interpretability output.

      "title": "Creativity in AI as Emergence from Domain-Limited Generative Models",
      "abstract": "Creativity in artificial intelligence is most often addressed through evaluative frameworks that aim to measure novelty, diversity, or usefulness in generated outputs. While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.",

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decouple model capacity from per-token computation, enabling scaling beyond the computational limits imposed by dense scaling laws. Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.",

      "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of 3D geospatial point clouds is pivotal for remote sensing applications. However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training.",

Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.",

Existing benchmarks typically employ position-agnostic relevance labels, conflating the challenge of processing long contexts with the bias against specific evidence locations. To address this challenge, we introduce PosIR (Position-Aware Information Retrieval), a comprehensive benchmark designed to diagnose position bias in diverse retrieval scenarios. PosIR comprises 310 datasets spanning 10 languages and 31 domains, constructed through a rigorous pipeline that ties relevance to precise reference spans, enabling the strict disentanglement of document length from information position. Extensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art embedding models reveal that: (1) Performance on PosIR in long-context settings correlates poorly with the MMTEB benchmark, exposing limitations in current short-text benchmarks; (2) Position bias is pervasive and intensifies with document length, with most models exhibiting primacy bias while certain models show unexpected recency bias; (3) Gradient-based saliency analysis further uncovers the distinct internal attention mechanisms driving these positional preferences. In summary, PosIR serves as a valuable diagnostic framework to foster the development of position-robust retrieval systems.",

Item and attribute information are bound using circular convolution, preserving embedding dimensionality while encoding structured metadata. A shallow selective state space backbone, inspired by recent Mamba-style models, enables efficient training and constant-time recurrent inference. Experiments on Amazon Beauty and MovieLens-1M datasets demonstrate that HoloMambaRec consistently outperforms SASRec and achieves competitive performance with GRU4Rec under a constrained 10-epoch training budget, while maintaining substantially lower memory complexity. The design further incorporates forward-compatible mechanisms for temporal bundling and inference-time compression, positioning HoloMambaRec as a practical and extensible alternative for scalable, metadata-aware sequential recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise from ships contribute significantly to underwater sound pollution, posing risks to marine ecosystems. This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.",

We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.",

To reduce the dominant prefill cost in such pipelines, recent work advocates KV cache reuse across partially shared contexts and reports substantial speedups for generation agents. In this work, we show that these efficiency gains do not transfer uniformly to judge-centric inference. Across GSM8K, MMLU, and HumanEval, we find that reuse strategies that are effective for execution agents can severely perturb judge behavior: end-task accuracy may appear stable, yet the judge's selection becomes highly inconsistent with dense prefill. We quantify this risk using Judge Consistency Rate (JCR) and provide diagnostics showing that reuse systematically weakens cross-candidate attention, especially for later candidate blocks. Our ablation further demonstrates that explicit cross-candidate interaction is crucial for preserving dense-prefill decisions. Overall, our results identify a previously overlooked failure mode of KV cache reuse and highlight judge-centric inference as a distinct regime that demands dedicated, risk-aware system design.",

Using few-shot large audio-language models and human annotation, we evaluate how modality affects detection accuracy and perception. Our results reveal that models exhibit high specificity but markedly lower recall on speech compared to text, suggesting sensitivity to missing acoustic or prosodic cues in training. Human raters show similar uncertainty in the audio setting, underscoring the inherent ambiguity of manipulative speech.

Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images. However, their feature-intensive attention computation incurs high computational cost. To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates.

      "abstract": "Automatic integration of whole slide images (WSIs) and gene expression profiles has demonstrated substantial potential in precision clinical diagnosis and cancer progression studies. However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively. BioMorphNet not only classifies tissue categories within WSIs accurately to support tumor localization, but also analyzes differential gene expression between tissue categories based on prediction confidence, contributing to the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks can lower technical barriers for predictive and prognostic model development in radiomics by enabling researchers without programming expertise to build models. However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.",

We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.",

      "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.",

Yet, no dedicated benchmarks or evaluation protocols exist to quantify the effectiveness of steering techniques. We introduce CLaS-Bench, a lightweight parallel-question benchmark for evaluating language-forcing behavior in LLMs across 32 languages, enabling systematic evaluation of multilingual steering methods. We evaluate a broad array of steering techniques, including residual-stream DiffMean interventions, probe-derived directions, language-specific neurons, PCA/LDA vectors, Sparse Autoencoders, and prompting baselines. Steering performance is measured along two axes: language control and semantic relevance, combined into a single harmonic-mean steering score. We find that across languages simple residual-based DiffMean method consistently outperforms all other methods. Moreover, a layer-wise analysis reveals that language-specific structure emerges predominantly in later layers and steering directions cluster based on language family. CLaS-Bench is the first standardized benchmark for multilingual steering, enabling both rigorous scientific analysis of language representations and practical evaluation of steering as a low-cost adaptation alternative.",

In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments.",

In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.",

The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training.

      "abstract": "Background:Subject-specific finite element analysis accurately characterizes knee joint mechanics but is computationally expensive. Deep surrogate models provide a rapid alternative, yet their generalization across subjects under limited pose and load inputs remains unclear. It remains unclear whether the dominant source of prediction uncertainty arises from temporal history dependence or spatial propagation dependence. Methods:To disentangle these factors, we employed a shared MGN backbone with a fixed mesh topology. A dataset of running trials from nine subjects was constructed using an OpenSim-FEBio workflow. We developed four model variants to isolate specific dependencies: (1) a baseline MGN; (2) CT-MGN, incorporating a Control Transformer to encode short-horizon history; (3) MsgModMGN, applying state-conditioned modulation to message passing for adaptive propagation; (4) CT-MsgModMGN, combining both mechanisms. Models were evaluated using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects.Results:The models incorporating history encoding significantly outperformed the baseline MGN and MsgModMGN in global accuracy and spatial consistency. Crucially, the CT module effectively mitigated the peak-shaving defect common in deep surrogates, significantly reducing peak stress prediction errors. In contrast, the spatial propagation modulation alone yielded no significant improvement over the baseline, and combining it with CT provided no additional benefit.Conclusion:Temporal history dependence, rather than spatial propagation modulation, is the primary driver of prediction uncertainty in cross-subject knee contact mechanics. Explicitly encoding short-horizon driver sequences enables the surrogate model to recover implicit phase information, thereby achieving superior fidelity in peak-stress capture and high-risk localization compared to purely state-based approaches.",

      "abstract": "Deep double descent is one of the key phenomena underlying the generalization capability of deep learning models. In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of \"deep double descent,\" \"benign overfitting,\" and \"large activation\", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.",

Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.",

      "abstract": "Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by leveraging long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but uniformly applying overlong reasoning at inference time incurs substantial and often unnecessary computational cost. To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.",

However, most existing approaches rely on a unified execution paradigm, which struggles to accommodate large variations in task complexity and incomplete tool availability commonly observed in agricultural environments. To address this challenge, we propose AgriAgent, a two-level agent framework for real-world agriculture. AgriAgent adopts a hierarchical execution strategy based on task complexity: simple tasks are handled through direct reasoning by modality-specific agents, while complex tasks trigger a contract-driven planning mechanism that formulates tasks as capability requirements and performs capability-aware tool orchestration and dynamic tool generation, enabling multi-step and verifiable execution with failure recovery. Experimental results show that AgriAgent achieves higher execution success rates and robustness on complex tasks compared to existing tool-centric agent baselines that rely on unified execution paradigms.

In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.",

It evaluates advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency against a baseline. Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.",

Lightweight architectures typically suffer significant performance loss. To address these deployment and speed constraints, we propose Region- and Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (ReCo-KD), a training-only framework that transfers both fine-grained anatomical detail and long-range contextual information from a high-capacity teacher to a compact student network. The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $Δ$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $Δ$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost.",

To investigate this, we introduce KidVis, a novel benchmark grounded in the theory of human visual development. KidVis deconstructs visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities - Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure - already possessed by 6-7 year old children, comprising 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against a human physiological baseline reveals a stark performance disparity. Results indicate that while human children achieve a near-perfect average score of 95.32, the state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Crucially, we observe a \"Scaling Law Paradox\": simply increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in these foundational visual capabilities. This study confirms that current MLLMs, despite their reasoning prowess, lack the essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence.",

Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.\n  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.\n  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.",

      "abstract": "Tool-Integrated Reasoning has emerged as a key paradigm to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with computational capabilities, yet integrating tool-use into long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of training data and the challenge of integrating tool-use without compromising the model's intrinsic long-chain reasoning. In this paper, we introduce DART (Discovery And Reinforcement of Tool-Integrated Reasoning Chains via Rollout Trees), a reinforcement learning framework that enables spontaneous tool-use during long CoT reasoning without human annotation. DART operates by constructing dynamic rollout trees during training to discover valid tool-use opportunities, branching out at promising positions to explore diverse tool-integrated trajectories. Subsequently, a tree-based process advantage estimation identifies and credits specific sub-trajectories where tool invocation positively contributes to the solution, effectively reinforcing these beneficial behaviors. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like AIME and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that DART significantly outperforms existing methods, successfully harmonizing tool execution with long CoT reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.",

We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-CoReasoner, a language-informed co-reasoning framework that elicits parallel English and local-language reasoning, abstracts them into structured concepts, and integrates local clinical knowledge into an English logical scaffold via concept-level alignment and retrieval. This design combines the structural robustness of English reasoning with the practice-grounded expertise encoded in local languages. To evaluate multilingual medical reasoning beyond multiple-choice settings, we construct MultiMed-X, a benchmark covering seven languages with expert-annotated long-form question answering and natural language inference tasks, comprising 350 instances per language. Experiments across three benchmarks show that Med-CoReasoner improves multilingual reasoning performance by an average of 5%, with particularly substantial gains in low-resource languages. Moreover, model distillation and expert evaluation analysis further confirm that Med-CoReasoner produces clinically sound and culturally grounded reasoning traces.",

AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain.",

By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a \"Skepticism Trap\" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination.

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.",

The Wishart distribution, $S=W_0W_0^\\top\\sim\\mathcal{W}_m(n,σ^2 \\boldsymbol{I}_m)$, used for computing the output marginal variance is derived in closed form using expectations of zonal polynomials via James' theorem and a Laplace-integral expansion of $(α\\boldsymbol{I}_m+S)^{-1}$.

Monte Carlo experiments confirm the theoretical estimates. Furthermore, empirical analysis was performed to quantify that, using current He or Kaiming initialization with scaling $1/\\sqrt{n}$, the output variance is $0.41$, whereas the new parameterization with $10/ \\sqrt{n}$ for $α=1$ results in an output variance of $0.9$. The findings clarify why deep $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz networks suffer rapid information loss at initialization and offer practical prescriptions for choosing initialization hyperparameters to mitigate this effect. However, using the Higgs boson classification dataset, a hyperparameter sweep over optimizers, initialization scale, and depth was conducted to validate the results on real-world data, showing that although the derivation ensures variance preservation, empirical results indicate He initialization still performs better.",

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.",

The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation.

      "abstract": "Dexterous grasp synthesis remains a central challenge: the high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands prevent direct transfer of algorithms developed for parallel-jaw grippers. Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics.

      "abstract": "Low-cost inertial navigation systems (INS) are prone to sensor biases and measurement noise, which lead to rapid degradation of navigation accuracy during global positioning system (GPS) outages. To address this challenge and improve positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GPS/INS fusion network (BGFN) based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). The BGFN architecture integrates a spiking Transformer with a spiking encoder to simultaneously extract spatial features from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and capture their temporal dynamics. By modeling the relationship between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments, the network leverages both current and historical IMU data to estimate vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through real-world field tests and experiments on public datasets. Compared to conventional deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate that BGFN achieves higher accuracy and enhanced reliability in navigation performance, particularly under prolonged GPS outages.",

      "abstract": "Unobtrusive sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart homes by processing data collected from IoT sensing devices supports applications such as healthcare, safety, and energy management. Recent zero-shot methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the advantage of removing the reliance on labeled ADL sensor data. However, existing approaches rely on time-based segmentation, which is poorly aligned with the contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, existing approaches lack methods for estimating prediction confidence. This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B). The proposed confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.",

An efficient polynomial-time algorithm is devised to identify them by determining the unique directed convex hulls containing the variables of interest from the original networks.

      "abstract": "While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.",

      "abstract": "The recent paradigm shift toward large reasoning models (LRMs) as autonomous agents has intensified the demand for sophisticated, multi-turn tool-use capabilities. Yet, existing datasets and data-generation approaches are limited by static, predefined toolsets that cannot scale to the complexity of open-ended human-agent collaboration. To address this, we initially developed a framework for automated task-oriented multi-turn dialogue generation at scale, utilizing an LRM-based simulator to dynamically generate high-value, domain-specific tools to solve specified tasks. However, we observe that a purely task-oriented design often results in \"solely task-solving\" trajectories, where the agent completes the objective with minimal interaction, failing to generate the high turn-count conversations seen in realistic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we shift toward a user-oriented simulation paradigm. By decoupling task generation from a dedicated user simulator that mimics human behavioral rules - such as incremental request-making and turn-by-turn feedback - we facilitate more authentic, extended multi-turn dialogues that reflect the iterative nature of real-world problem solving. Our generation pipeline operates as a versatile, plug-and-play module capable of initiating generation from any state, ensuring high scalability in producing extended tool-use data. Furthermore, by facilitating multiple task completions within a single trajectory, it yields a high-density dataset that reflects the multifaceted demands of real-world human-agent interaction.",

Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning protocols require repeated synchronization between clients and a central server, with convergence rates depending on learning rates, data heterogeneity, and client sampling. This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \\ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\\times$ less communication. The framework applies to kernel methods and random feature models but not to general nonlinear architectures.",

This motivates a simple principle for MoE design which maximizes $N_{total}$ while minimizing $s$ (maximizing $n_{topk}$) and $n_{exp}$ under the given constraints. Our findings provide a robust framework for resolving architectural ambiguity and guiding MoE design.",

      "abstract": "Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has attracted considerable attention due to its potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "In domains such as biomedicine, materials, and finance, high-stakes deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires injecting private, domain-specific knowledge that is proprietary, fast-evolving, and under-represented in public pretraining. However, the two dominant paradigms for private knowledge injection each have pronounced drawbacks: fine-tuning is expensive to iterate, and continual updates risk catastrophic forgetting and general-capability regression; retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) keeps the base model intact but is brittle in specialized private corpora due to chunk-induced evidence fragmentation, retrieval drift, and long-context pressure that yields query-dependent prompt inflation. Inspired by how multimodal LLMs align heterogeneous modalities into a shared semantic space, we propose Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which treats private expertise as an additional expert modality and injects it via a compact, representation-level interface aligned to the frozen base model, avoiding prompt-time evidence serialization while enabling plug-and-play specialization and scalable multi-domain composition with reliable selective activation. Across two private scientific QA benchmarks (immunology adjuvant and catalytic materials) and mixed-domain evaluations, GAG improves specialist performance over strong RAG baselines by 15.34% and 14.86% on the two benchmarks, respectively, while maintaining performance on six open general benchmarks and enabling near-oracle selective activation for scalable multi-domain deployment.",

FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks.

While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors. These unified signal tokens are then fed into a Transformer-based decoder, which employs an autoregressive mechanism to generate coherent action descriptions word-by-word. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, and WiFiTAD). Experimental results demonstrate that MobiDiary effectively generalizes across modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on captioning metrics (e.g., BLEU@4, CIDEr, RMC) and outperforming specialized baselines in continuous action understanding.",

However, SPIN is designed to optimize the current reward advantages of annotated responses over synthetic responses at hand, which may gradually vanish during iterations, leading to unstable optimization. Moreover, the utilization of reference policy induces a misalignment issue between the reward formulation for training and the metric for generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Triplet-based Self-Play fIne-tuNing (T-SPIN) method that integrates two key designs. First, beyond current advantages, T-SPIN additionally incorporates historical advantages between iteratively generated responses and proto-synthetic responses produced by the initial policy. Even if the current advantages diminish, historical advantages remain effective, stabilizing the overall optimization. Second, T-SPIN introduces the entropy constraint into the self-play framework, which is theoretically justified to support reference-free fine-tuning, eliminating the training-generation discrepancy. Empirical results on various tasks demonstrate not only the superior performance of T-SPIN over SPIN, but also its stable evolution during iterations. Remarkably, compared to supervised fine-tuning, T-SPIN achieves comparable or even better performance with only 25% samples, highlighting its effectiveness when faced with scarce annotated data.",

      "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has enabled complex tool use, yet in high-stakes domains, these systems must strictly adhere to regulatory standards beyond simple functional correctness. However, existing benchmarks often overlook implicit regulatory compliance, thus failing to evaluate whether LLMs can autonomously enforce mandatory safety constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce LogiSafetyGen, a framework that converts unstructured regulations into Linear Temporal Logic oracles and employs logic-guided fuzzing to synthesize valid, safety-critical traces. Building on this framework, we construct LogiSafetyBench, a benchmark comprising 240 human-verified tasks that require LLMs to generate Python programs that satisfy both functional objectives and latent compliance rules. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal that larger models, despite achieving better functional correctness, frequently prioritize task completion over safety, which results in non-compliant behavior.",

      "abstract": "Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.",

      "abstract": "Medical image analysis increasingly relies on large vision-language models (VLMs), yet most systems remain single-pass black boxes that offer limited control over reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding. We propose R^4, an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents: a Router that configures task- and specialization-aware prompts from the image, patient history, and metadata; a Retriever that uses exemplar memory and pass@k sampling to jointly generate free-text reports and bounding boxes; a Reflector that critiques each draft-box pair for key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, and localization errors); and a Repairer that iteratively revises both narrative and spatial outputs under targeted constraints while curating high-quality exemplars for future cases. Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning. These results show that agentic routing, reflection, and repair can turn strong but brittle VLMs into more reliable and better grounded tools for clinical image interpretation.

      "abstract": "Lightweight vision networks have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet achieving a satisfactory balance among parameter scale, computational overhead, and task performance remains difficult. Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.",

Such self-driving laboratories can not only increase the throughput of repetitive experiments, but also incorporate human domain expertise to drive the search towards user-defined objectives, including improved materials performance metrics. We present an autonomous materials synthesis extension to SARA, the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent, utilizing phase information provided by an automated probabilistic phase labeling algorithm to expedite the search for targeted phase regions. By incorporating human input into an expanded SARA-H (SARA with human-in-the-loop) framework, we enhance the efficiency of the underlying reasoning process. Using synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the efficiency of our AI implementation and show that the human input can contribute to significant improvement in sampling efficiency. We conduct experimental active learning campaigns using robotic processing of thin-film samples of several oxide material systems, including Bi$_2$O$_3$, SnO$_x$, and Bi-Ti-O, using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing to synthesize and kinetically trap metastable phases. We showcase the utility of human-in-the-loop autonomous experimentation for the Bi-Ti-O system, where we identify extensive processing domains that stabilize $δ$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ and Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, explore dwell-dependent ternary oxide phase behavior, and provide evidence confirming predictions that cationic substitutional doping of TiO$_2$ with Bi inhibits the unfavorable transformation of the metastable anatase to the ground-state rutile phase.

For Markov chains, we further prove that the regeneration time of the split chain associated with a geometrically ergodic chain has a geometric tail without assuming strong aperiodicity or other restrictive conditions.

To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical \"spatial grounding bottleneck\" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a \"fluency-accuracy paradox\": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to \"over-interpretation\" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points. The experimental results have verified that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization error, robustness to image blur transformation, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.",

We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models.

To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly.

In this paper, we study prompt-based clarity evaluation using the CLARITY dataset from the SemEval 2026 shared task. We compare a GPT-3.5 baseline provided with the dataset against GPT-5.2 evaluated under three prompting strategies: simple prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought with few-shot examples. Model predictions are evaluated against human annotations using accuracy and class-wise metrics for clarity and evasion, along with hierarchical exact match. Results show that GPT-5.2 consistently outperforms the GPT-3.5 baseline on clarity prediction, with accuracy improving from 56 percent to 63 percent under chain-of-thought with few-shot prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting yields the highest evasion accuracy at 34 percent, though improvements are less stable across fine-grained evasion categories. We further evaluate topic identification and find that reasoning-based prompting improves accuracy from 60 percent to 74 percent relative to human annotations. Overall, our findings indicate that prompt design reliably improves high-level clarity evaluation, while fine-grained evasion and topic detection remain challenging despite structured reasoning prompts.",

      "abstract": "Many real-world tasks require optimizing expensive black-box functions accessible only through noisy evaluations, a setting commonly addressed with Bayesian optimization (BO). While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \\times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines.",

Recent work using causal mediation analysis has shown that a small set of attention heads encodes task representation in in-context learning, captured in a compact representation known as the function vector. We show that fine-tuning function vectors with only a small set of examples (about 20 word pairs) yields better performance on relation-based word-completion tasks than using the original vectors derived from causal mediation analysis. These improvements hold for both small and large language models. Moreover, the fine-tuned function vectors yield improved decoding performance for relation words and show stronger alignment with human similarity judgments of semantic relations. Next, we introduce the composite function vector - a weighted combination of fine-tuned function vectors - to extract relational knowledge and support analogical reasoning. At inference time, inserting this composite vector into LLM activations markedly enhances performance on challenging analogy problems drawn from cognitive science and SAT benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of activation patching as a controllable mechanism for encoding and manipulating relational knowledge, advancing both the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of large language models.",

      "abstract": "Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.",

Intense combustion creates dense particulate haze and luminance variations exceeding 120 dB, degrading image data and undermining subsequent photogrammetric and velocimetric analyses. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region. This offers a reliable image basis for extracting key mechanical parameters, including particle velocity, flow instability frequency, and structural vibration, thereby supporting precise quantitative analysis in extreme aerospace environments.",

A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting.

However, existing memory frameworks suffer from a fundamental limitation: they perform exhaustive retrieval across the entire storage layer regardless of query characteristics. This brute-force approach creates severe latency bottlenecks as memory grows, hindering real-time agent interactions. We propose SwiftMem, a query-aware agentic memory system that achieves sub-linear retrieval through specialized indexing over temporal and semantic dimensions. Our temporal index enables logarithmic-time range queries for time-sensitive retrieval, while the semantic DAG-Tag index maps queries to relevant topics through hierarchical tag structures. To address memory fragmentation during growth, we introduce an embedding-tag co-consolidation mechanism that reorganizes storage based on semantic clusters to improve cache locality. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftMem achieves 47$\\times$ faster search compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment of memory-augmented LLM agents.",

This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.",

To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple architectures, revealing how visual-text fusion evolves within MLLMs. The results show that fusion emerges at several specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed across the network, and certain models exhibit a late-stage \"review\" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts. Extensive experiments across various MLLMs and benchmarks validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed approach improves multimodal reasoning performance. Code will be released.",

However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings.",

However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance.",

Across NusaX-Senti and XNLI, CT-SFT improves cross-lingual accuracy over continued full fine-tuning while updating only a small subset of model parameters. We find an editing-preserving trade-off: harder transfers favor editing circuit heads, while easier transfers often favor near-zero (i.e., low-relevance heads) updates, preserving the source mechanism. CT-SFT also substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting, preserving proxy/source-language competence during transfer.",

To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains.",

Existing multilingual models demonstrate poor performance on Urdu-specific tasks, struggling with the language's complex morphology, right-to-left Nastaliq script, and rich literary traditions. Even the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model shows limited capability in generating fluent, contextually appropriate Urdu text. We introduce Qalb, an Urdu language model developed through a two-stage approach: continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Starting from LLaMA 3.1 8B, we perform continued pre-training on a dataset of 1.97 billion tokens. This corpus comprises 1.84 billion tokens of diverse Urdu text-spanning news archives, classical and contemporary literature, government documents, and social media-combined with 140 million tokens of English Wikipedia data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We then fine-tune the resulting model on the Alif Urdu-instruct dataset. Through extensive evaluation on Urdu-specific benchmarks, Qalb demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a weighted average score of 90.34 and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Alif-1.0-Instruct model (87.1) by 3.24 points, while also surpassing the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model by 44.64 points. Qalb achieves state-of-the-art performance with comprehensive evaluation across seven diverse tasks including Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Reasoning. Our results demonstrate that continued pre-training on diverse, high-quality language data, combined with targeted instruction fine-tuning, effectively adapts foundation models to low-resource languages.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion and flow policies are gaining prominence in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressive power, yet training them efficiently remains a critical challenge. A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.",

      "abstract": "Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.",

To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures. Our central finding is a persistent trade-off between discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE): text-based encoders achieve the best AUROC (0.672), while structurally-aware models yield the best ECE (0.148), with no single method dominating both. Furthermore, we find that increased architectural complexity does not reliably outperform simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods relying solely on chunk-level hidden states. This work provides the most comprehensive benchmark for this task to date, establishing rigorous baselines and demonstrating the limitations of current representation-based paradigms.",

      "abstract": "Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \\textit{S}tepping \\textit{S}tone \\textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results.",

To resolve this, we propose ExoFormer, which learns dedicated exogenous anchor projections outside the sequential layer stack, decoupling the anchor role from computational refinement. Through a unified normalized mixing framework (studying different coefficient granularities: elementwise, headwise, scalar) across all attention pathways (queries, keys, values, and gate logits), ExoFormer variants consistently outperform their internal-anchor counterparts. Moreover, the dynamic variant achieves a 2.13-point increase in downstream accuracy over the baseline and demonstrates superior data efficiency, matching baseline validation loss with 1.84x fewer tokens. ExoFormer also achieves a 2x reduction in attention sink compared to standard Gated Attention. Paradoxically, all ExoFormer variants exhibit signs of representation collapse. We explain this via an Offloading Hypothesis: external anchors preserve essential token identity, allowing layers to specialize exclusively in computational refinement.

While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has driven broad advances across scientific and engineering domains. Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.",

In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features.",

Traditional approaches--independent training and multi-task learning--struggle with either excessive computational costs or negative transfer. A recently proposed multi-policy approach, Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), has demonstrated effectiveness by strategically selecting a few tasks to train and zero-shot transfer. However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric.

Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere.

The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.",

      "abstract": "We describe a novel system, CSQL, which automatically converts a collection of unstructured text documents into an SQL-queryable causal database (CDB). A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science.",

To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Causal Prompting with Sketch-of-Thought (ACPS) framework, which leverages structural causal models to infer the causal effect of a query on its answer and adaptively select an appropriate intervention (i.e., standard front-door and conditional front-door adjustments). This design enables generalisable causal reasoning across heterogeneous tasks without task-specific retraining. By replacing verbose CoT with concise Sketch-of-Thought, ACPS enables efficient reasoning that significantly reduces token usage and inference cost.

      "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation with tool-calling agents (agentic RAG) has become increasingly powerful in understanding, processing, and responding to user queries. However, the scope of the grounding knowledge is limited and asking questions that exceed this scope may lead to issues like hallucination. While guardrail frameworks aim to block out-of-scope questions (Rodriguez et al., 2024), no research has investigated the question of suggesting answerable queries in order to complete the user interaction.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of query suggestion for agentic RAG. We consider the setting where user questions are not answerable, and the suggested queries should be similar to aid the user interaction. Such scenarios are frequent for tool-calling LLMs as communicating the restrictions of the tools or the underlying datasets to the user is difficult, and adding query suggestions enhances the interaction with the RAG agent. As opposed to traditional settings for query recommendations such as in search engines, ensuring that the suggested queries are answerable is a major challenge due to the RAG's multi-step workflow that demands a nuanced understanding of the RAG as a whole, which the executing LLM lacks. As such, we introduce robust dynamic few-shot learning which retrieves examples from relevant workflows. We show that our system can be self-learned, for instance on prior user queries, and is therefore easily applicable in practice. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets based on two unlabeled question datasets collected from real-world user queries. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces more relevant and answerable suggestions, outperforming few-shot and retrieval-only baselines, and thus enable safer, more effective user interaction with agentic RAG.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the generalization behavior of deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in modern statistical learning theory. Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning.",

To address this, we propose AdaJudge, a unified framework that jointly adapts representation and aggregation. AdaJudge first refines backbone representations into a discrimination-oriented space via gated refinement blocks. It then replaces the static readout with an adaptive multi-view pooling module that dynamically routes and combines evidence. Extensive experiments on RM-Bench and JudgeBench show that AdaJudge outperforms strong off-the-shelf reward models and traditional pooling baselines.",

Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \\texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes.

Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget.

Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation.

      "abstract": "Negative constraints (instructions of the form \"do not use word X\") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=σ(-2.40+2.27\\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.",

Existing work evaluates CE methods almost exclusively through calibration, examining whether stated confidence aligns with accuracy, or discrimination, whether confidence is ranked higher for correct predictions than incorrect ones. However, these facets ignore pitfalls of CE in the context of LLMs and language variation: confidence estimates should remain consistent under semantically equivalent prompt or answer variations, and should change when the answer meaning differs. Therefore, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for CE that measures their confidence quality on three new aspects: robustness of confidence against prompt perturbations, stability across semantic equivalent answers, and sensitivity to semantically different answers. In our work, we demonstrate that common CE methods for LLMs often fail on these metrics: methods that achieve good performance on calibration or discrimination are not robust to prompt variations or are not sensitive to answer changes. Overall, our framework reveals limitations of existing CE evaluations relevant for real-world LLM use cases and provides practical guidance for selecting and designing more reliable CE methods.",

We prove that chaining a language model's autoregressive output is sufficient to perform universal computation. That is, a language model can simulate the execution of any algorithm on any input. The challenge of eliciting desired computational behaviour can thus be reframed in terms of programmability: the ease of finding a suitable prompt. Strikingly, we demonstrate that even randomly initialized language models are capable of universal computation before training. This implies that training does not give rise to computational expressiveness -- rather, it improves programmability, enabling a natural language interface for accessing these intrinsic capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has improved the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear why it works and whether it is the unique mechanism for triggering reasoning in large language models. In this work, we study this question by directly analyzing and intervening on the internal representations of LLMs with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), identifying a small set of latent features that are causally associated with LLM reasoning behavior. Across multiple model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that steering a single reasoning-related latent feature can substantially improve accuracy without explicit CoT prompting. For large models, latent steering achieves performance comparable to standard CoT prompting while producing more efficient outputs. We further observe that this reasoning-oriented internal state is triggered early in generation and can override prompt-level instructions that discourage explicit reasoning. Overall, our results suggest that multi-step reasoning in LLMs is supported by latent internal activations that can be externally activated, while CoT prompting is one effective, but not unique, way of activating this mechanism rather than its necessary cause.",

This is enabled by leveraging neuromechanical digital twins: computational models that embed artificial neural controllers within realistic body models in simulated environments. Here we review advances in the creation and use of neuromechanical digital twins while also highlighting emerging opportunities for the future. First, we illustrate how neuromechanical models allow researchers to infer hidden biophysical variables that may be difficult to measure experimentally. Additionally, by perturbing these models, one can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses. Next, we explore how neuromechanical twins have been used to foster a deeper exchange between neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a compact alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate spline functions on edges rather than fixed activations on nodes, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters. However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality. Our lightweight KAN model (50K parameters, 0.19~MB) achieves 99.0\\% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 DoS dataset. After LUT compilation with resolution $L=8$, the model maintains 98.96\\% accuracy (F1 degradation $<0.0004$) while achieving $\\mathbf{68\\times}$ speedup at batch size 256 and over $\\mathbf{5000\\times}$ speedup at batch size 1, with only $2\\times$ memory overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs.

Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance.

Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring. The integration of electromagnetic tagging with machine learning enables scalable and efficient drone identification, paving the way for enhanced aerial traffic management and security in increasingly congested airspaces.",

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.",

Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.\n  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.\n  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance.

Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.",

To alleviate this problem, input selection approaches have been developed in recent years to identify small, yet highly informative subsets for labeling. Diversity-based selection is one of the most effective approaches for this purpose. However, they are often computationally intensive and lack scalability for large input sets, limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce Concept-Based Diversity (CBD), a highly efficient metric for image inputs that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM). Our results show that CBD exhibits a strong correlation with Geometric Diversity (GD), an established diversity metric, while requiring only a fraction of its computation time. Building on this finding, we propose a hybrid input selection approach that combines CBD with Margin, a simple uncertainty metric. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of DNN models, input sets, selection budgets, and five most effective state-of-the-art selection baselines. The results demonstrate that the CBD-based selection consistently outperforms all baselines at guiding input selection to improve the DNN model. Furthermore, the CBD-based selection approach remains highly efficient, requiring selection times close to those of simple uncertainty-based methods such as Margin, even on larger input sets like ImageNet. These results confirm not only the effectiveness and computational advantage of the CBD-based approach, particularly compared to hybrid baselines, but also its scalability in repetitive and extensive input selection scenarios.",

In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective training-free vision-only ZSAD framework that circumvents the need for fine-grained prompts by leveraging the inversion of a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). Specifically, given an input image and a generic text description (e.g., \"an image of an [object class]\"), we invert the image to obtain latent representations and initiate the denoising process from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct the image. Since the underlying diffusion model is trained solely on normal data, this process yields a normal-looking reconstruction. The discrepancy between the input image and the reconstructed one highlights potential anomalies. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VISA dataset, demonstrating strong localisation capabilities without auxiliary modalities and facilitating a shift away from prompt dependence for zero-shot anomaly detection research.

However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE. Case studies for the major destination port further illustrate the model's superior accuracy.",

We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with creative generation, and multi-agent frameworks that improve reasoning through interaction can paradoxically hinder creativity by inducing content homogenization. We introduce LLM Review, a peer-review-inspired framework implementing Blind Peer Review: agents exchange targeted feedback while revising independently, preserving divergent creative trajectories. To enable rigorous evaluation, we propose SciFi-100, a science fiction writing dataset with a unified framework combining LLM-as-a-judge scoring, human annotation, and rule-based novelty metrics. Experiments demonstrate that LLM Review consistently outperforms multi-agent baselines, and smaller models with our framework can surpass larger single-agent models, suggesting interaction structure may substitute for model scale.",

Concept Vector Projections (CVP) offer a recent solution: by modeling sentiment as a direction in embedding space, they produce continuous, multilingual scores that align closely with human judgments.

We evaluate CVP across genres, historical periods, languages, and affective dimensions, finding that concept vectors trained on one corpus transfer well to others with minimal performance loss. To understand the patterns of generalization, we further examine the linearity assumption underlying CVP. Our findings suggest that while CVP is a portable approach that effectively captures generalizable patterns, its linearity assumption is approximate, pointing to potential for further development.",

We introduce DyCP, a lightweight context management method that dynamically segment and retrieve relevant memory at query time. It preserves the sequential structure of dialogue without predefined topic boundaries and supports efficient, adaptive context retrieval. Across three long-form dialogue benchmarks, LoCoMo, MT-Bench+, and SCM4LLMs, and multiple LLMs, DyCP consistently improves answer quality while reducing response latency.

We demonstrate the issues ensued by traditional pipeline and our proposed improvements on a dataset of 17k daily diary transcripts paired with PTSD symptom severity from 238 participants, finding that traditional document-level evaluation can yield substantially different and sometimes reversed conclusions compared to our ecologically valid modeling and evaluation.

This paper introduces a comprehensive data collection and processing pipeline that constructs multimodal fact-checking datasets in French and German languages by aggregating ClaimReview feeds, scraping full debunking articles, normalizing heterogeneous claim verdicts, and enriching them with structured metadata and aligned visual content. We used state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs for (i) evidence extraction under predefined evidence categories and (ii) justification generation that links evidence to verdicts. Evaluation with G-Eval and human assessment demonstrates that our pipeline enables fine-grained comparison of fact-checking practices across different organizations or media markets, facilitates the development of more interpretable and evidence-grounded fact-checking models, and lays the groundwork for future research on multilingual, multimodal misinformation verification.",

The framework outputs a calibrated cultural-understanding score for model selection and cultural-gap diagnosis, together with dimension-level diagnostics and risk indicators. We evaluate 15 VLMs on 294 expert anchors spanning six cultural traditions. Key findings are that (i) automated metrics are unreliable proxies for cultural depth, (ii) Western samples score higher than non-Western samples under our sampling and rubric, and (iii) cross-judge scale mismatch makes naive score averaging unreliable, motivating a single primary judge with explicit calibration.

We construct a comprehensive benchmark that spans 6 prompting strategies, 7 large language models (LLMs), and 4 domain datasets, resulting in a diverse set of human- and AI-generated texts. Using this dataset, we fine-tune classification-based detectors on various generation settings and evaluate their cross-prompt, cross-model, and cross-dataset generalization. To explain the performance variance, we compute correlations between generalization accuracies and feature shifts of 80 linguistic features between training and test conditions. Our analysis reveals that generalization performance for specific detectors and evaluation conditions is significantly associated with linguistic features such as tense usage and pronoun frequency.",

While this challenge has gained attention in NLP, existing work lacks both nuance and coverage in understanding and evaluating models' norm adherence. We address these gaps by introducing a taxonomy of norms that clarifies their contexts (e.g., distinguishing between human-human norms that models should recognize and human-AI interactional norms that apply to the human-AI interaction itself), specifications (e.g., relevant domains), and mechanisms (e.g., modes of enforcement). We demonstrate how our taxonomy can be operationalized to automatically evaluate models' norm adherence in naturalistic, open-ended settings. Our exploratory analyses suggest that state-of-the-art models frequently violate norms, though violation rates vary by model, interactional context, and country. We further show that violation rates also vary by prompt intent and situational framing. Our taxonomy and demonstrative evaluation pipeline enable nuanced, context-sensitive evaluation of cultural norm adherence in realistic settings.",

Using both the scenario-based questions and the traditional value questionnaire, we evaluate ten frontier LLMs (five from U.S. companies, five from Chinese ones) and human participants ($n = 55$). We find near-perfect cross-model consistency in scenario-based decisions (Pearson $r \\approx 1.0$), contrasting sharply with the broad variability observed among humans ($r \\in [-0.79, 0.98]$). Yet, both humans and LLMs show weak correspondence between self-reported and enacted values ($r = 0.4, 0.3$), revealing a systematic knowledge-action gap. When instructed to \"hold\" a specific value, LLMs' performance declines up to $6.6%$ compared to merely selecting the value, indicating a role-play aversion. These findings suggest that while alignment training yields normative value convergence, it does not eliminate the human-like incoherence between knowing and acting upon values.",

Experimental results, conducted entirely within the Chinese medical ethics context, demonstrate that our aligned model outperforms notably larger baselines on core ethical tasks, with observed improvements in both quality and composite evaluation metrics.

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted focus from general-purpose capabilities to domain-specific expertise. However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the \"Stability-Plasticity Dilemma\", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) \"Task Interference\", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a \"Knowledge-Preservation Plugin\", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.",

Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.",

      "abstract": "Post-training algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning can push the limits of robotic models for specific objectives, such as generalizability, accuracy, and robustness. However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training. Videos and code are available at https://failure-aware-rl.github.io.",

      "abstract": "In human conversation, both interlocutors play an active role in maintaining mutual understanding. When addressees are uncertain about what speakers mean, for example, they can request clarification. It is an open question for language models whether they can assume a similar addressee role, recognizing and expressing their own uncertainty through clarification. We argue that reference games are a good testbed to approach this question as they are controlled, self-contained, and make clarification needs explicit and measurable. To test this, we evaluate three vision-language models comparing a baseline reference resolution task to an experiment where the models are instructed to request clarification when uncertain. The results suggest that even in such simple tasks, models often struggle to recognize internal uncertainty and translate it into adequate clarification behavior. This demonstrates the value of reference games as testbeds for interaction qualities of (vision and) language models.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.",

This study examines the alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments.

The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. In addition, we introduce a new calibration metric, Gender-ECE, designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as conversational partners for learning, yet the interactional dynamics supporting users' learning and engagement are understudied. We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems.",

This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.",

These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.",

To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.",

Existing single-dimensional reflection methods offer insufficient improvements.

After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning.",

We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision.

However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.",

We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.",

      "abstract": "Numerical reasoning is an important task in the analysis of financial documents. It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM.",

      "abstract": "This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.",

These comparisons rely on large sets of high-fidelity synthetic images enabling deep exploration of the 6 degrees of freedom. A low-discrepancy sampling of the space allows to check the correlations between each degree of freedom and the pose errors by plotting the 36 pairs of combinations. The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy. This method is applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation. The code is open source and available on GitHub.",

      "abstract": "Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.",

However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of \"Enhanced\" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as \"Agentic\" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.",

However, current simulators suffer from two critical limitations: (1) they fail to capture the behavioral diversity of real-world seekers, often portraying them as overly cooperative, and (2) they lack the controllability required to simulate specific seeker profiles. To address these challenges, we present a controllable seeker simulator driven by nine psychological and linguistic features that underpin seeker behavior. Using authentic Reddit conversations, we train our model via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which effectively differentiates diverse seeker behaviors into specialized parameter subspaces, thereby enhancing fine-grained controllability. Our simulator achieves superior profile adherence and behavioral diversity compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, evaluating 7 prominent supporter models with our system uncovers previously obscured performance degradations. These findings underscore the utility of our framework in providing a more faithful and stress-tested evaluation for emotional support chatbots.",

Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and designed with motors enclosed inside to protect them from damage and dirt. Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism. The hand also successfully executed several daily tasks, including closing bottle caps and orienting a pen for writing.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.",

Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.",

      "title": "OSCAR: Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image",
      "abstract": "6D object pose estimation plays a crucial role in scene understanding for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.",

      "title": "Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Multi-Goal Tasks in Autonomous Forklifts",
      "abstract": "Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\\% (compared to 62.5\\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.",

Existing solutions typically resort to training embodiment-specific models, which scales poorly and fails to exploit shared motion semantics. To address this, we present AdaMorph, a unified neural retargeting framework that enables a single model to adapt human motion to diverse robot morphologies. Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration. Experimental results on 12 distinct humanoid robots demonstrate that AdaMorph effectively unifies control across heterogeneous topologies, exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to unseen complex motions while preserving the dynamic essence of the source behaviors.",

To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle.

Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.",

This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions.

Existing methods lack internal reasoning mechanisms that can identify task-relevant interaction cues or track progress within a subtask, leading to critical execution errors such as repeated actions, missed steps, and premature termination. To address these challenges, we introduce PALM, a VLA framework that structures policy learning around interaction-centric affordance reasoning and subtask progress cues. PALM distills complementary affordance representations that capture object relevance, contact geometry, spatial placements, and motion dynamics, and serve as task-relevant anchors for visuomotor control. To further stabilize long-horizon execution, PALM predicts continuous within-subtask progress, enabling seamless subtask transitions. Across extensive simulation and real-world experiments, PALM consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 91.8% success rate on LIBERO-LONG, a 12.5% improvement in average length on CALVIN ABC->D, and a 2x improvement over real-world baselines across three long-horizon generalization settings.",

The wrist mechanism is modeled using a Timoshenko-based approach to accurately capture its kinematic and dynamic properties, which serve as the foundation for tendon force calculations within the controller. The proposed SMC is designed to deliver fast dynamic response and computational efficiency, enabling accurate trajectory tracking under varying operating conditions. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through comparative analyses with existing controllers for similar wrist mechanisms. The proposed SMC demonstrates superior performance in both simulation and experimental studies. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in simulation is approximately 1.67e-2 radians, while experimental validation yields an error of 0.2 radians. Additionally, the controller achieves a settling time of less than 3 seconds and a steady-state error below 1e-1 radians, consistently observed across both simulation and experimental evaluations. Comparative analyses confirm that the developed SMC surpasses alternative control strategies in motion accuracy, rapid convergence, and steady-state precision.

Addressing the limitations of conventional opacity or depth-based cues, we introduce a geometry-aware viewpoint evaluation pipeline that explicitly models back-face visibility and occlusion-aware multi-view covisibility, reliably identifying under-reconstructed regions even on geometrically complex objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of greedy planning strategies, ObjSplat employs a next-best-path (NBP) planner that performs multi-step lookahead on a dynamically constructed spatial graph. By jointly optimizing information gain and movement cost, this planner generates globally efficient trajectories. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real-world cultural artifacts demonstrate that ObjSplat produces physically consistent models within minutes, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and surface completeness while significantly reducing scan time and path length compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.",

This work introduces a novel bearing-box approach that fully leverages modern 3D detection measurements that are widely available nowadays but have not been well explored for motion estimation so far. Unlike existing methods that rely on restrictive assumptions such as isotropic target shape and lateral motion, our bearing-box estimator can estimate both the target's motion and its physical size without these assumptions by exploiting the information buried in a 3D bounding box. When applied to multi-rotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), the estimator yields an interesting advantage: it further removes the need for higher-order motion assumptions by exploiting the unique coupling between MAV's acceleration and thrust. This is particularly significant, as higher-order motion assumptions are widely believed to be necessary in state-of-the-art bearing-based estimators. We support our claims with rigorous observability analyses and extensive experimental validation, demonstrating the estimator's superior performance in real-world scenarios.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel family of single-track vehicle models that incorporate a distributed representation of transient tyre dynamics, whilst simultaneously accounting for nonlinear effects induced by friction. The core of the proposed framework is represented by the distributed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) model, which unifies and extends classical formulations such as Dahl and LuGre by describing the rolling contact process as a spatially distributed system governed by semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This model is systematically integrated into a single-track vehicle framework, where the resulting semilinear ODE-PDE interconnection captures the interaction between lateral vehicle motion and tyre deformation. Two main variants are considered: one with rigid tyre carcass and another with flexible carcass, each admitting a compact state-space representation. Local and global well-posedness properties for the coupled system are established rigorously, highlighting the dissipative and physically consistent properties of the distributed FrBD model. A linearisation procedure is also presented, enabling spectral analysis and transfer function derivation, and potentially facilitating the synthesis of controllers and observers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to capture micro-shimmy oscillations and transient lateral responses to advanced steering manoeuvres. The proposed formulation advances the state-of-the-art in vehicle dynamics modelling by providing a physically grounded, mathematically rigorous, and computationally tractable approach to incorporating transient tyre behaviour in lateral vehicle dynamics, when accounting for the effect of limited friction.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a single-actuator passive gripper that achieves both stable grasping and continuous bidirectional in-hand rotation through mechanically encoded power transmission logic. Unlike conventional multifunctional grippers that require multiple actuators, sensors, or control-based switching, the proposed gripper transitions between grasping and rotation solely according to the magnitude of the applied input torque. The key enabler of this behavior is a Twisted Underactuated Mechanism (TUM), which generates non-coplanar motions, namely axial contraction and rotation, from a single rotational input while producing identical contraction regardless of rotation direction. A friction generator mechanically defines torque thresholds that govern passive mode switching, enabling stable grasp establishment before autonomously transitioning to in-hand rotation without sensing or active control. Analytical models describing the kinematics, elastic force generation, and torque transmission of the TUM are derived and experimentally validated. The fabricated gripper is evaluated through quantitative experiments on grasp success, friction-based grasp force regulation, and bidirectional rotation performance. System-level demonstrations, including bolt manipulation, object reorientation, and manipulator-integrated tasks driven solely by wrist torque, confirm reliable grasp to rotate transitions in both rotational directions. These results demonstrate that non-coplanar multifunctional manipulation can be realized through mechanical design alone, establishing mechanically encoded power transmission logic as a robust alternative to actuator and control intensive gripper architectures.",

To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Such results highlight the importance of global spatial representations for generalizable navigation.",

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for general-purpose robot learning, enabling agents to map visual observations and natural-language instructions into executable robotic actions. Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.",

However, several high-profile incidents involving large-scale drone failures -- where multiple drones simultaneously fall from the sky -- have raised safety and reliability concerns. To ensure robustness, we propose a drone parking algorithm designed specifically for multiple drone failures in drone light shows, aimed at mitigating the risk of cascading collisions by drone evacuation and enabling rapid recovery from failures by leveraging strategically placed hidden drones. Our algorithm integrates a Social LSTM model with attention mechanisms to predict the trajectories of failing drones and compute near-optimal evacuation paths that minimize the likelihood of surviving drones being hit by fallen drones. In the recovery node, our system deploys hidden drones (operating with their LED lights turned off) to replace failed drones so that the drone light show can continue. Our experiments showed that our approach can greatly increase the robustness of a multi-drone system by leveraging deep learning to predict the trajectories of fallen drones.",

We propose a novel semantic navigation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer patterns from partial observations and predict regions where the goal is most likely located. Our method combines local perceptual inputs with frontier-based exploration and periodic LLM queries, which extract symbolic patterns (e.g., room numbering schemes and building layout structures) and update a confidence grid used to guide exploration. This enables robots to move efficiently toward goal locations labeled with textual identifiers (e.g., \"room 8\") even before direct observation. We demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient navigation in sparse, partially observable grid environments by exploiting symbolic patterns. Experiments across environments modeled after real floor plans show that our approach consistently achieves near-optimal paths and outperforms baselines by over 25% in Success weighted by Path Length.",

In TLM, a laser beam is used to cut target tissue, while forceps are employed to grasp, manipulate, and stabilize tissue within the UADT. Although TLM systems may rely on different technologies and interfaces, forceps manipulation is still predominantly performed manually, introducing limitations in ergonomics, precision, and controllability. This paper proposes a novel robotic system for tissue manipulation in UADT procedures, based on a novel end-effector designed for forceps control. The system is integrated within a teleoperation framework that employs a robotic manipulator with a programmed remote center of motion (RCM), enabling precise and constrained instrument motion while improving surgeon ergonomics. The proposed approach is validated through two experimental studies and a dedicated usability evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and suitability for UADT surgical applications.",

      "abstract": "Inertial localization is particularly valuable in GPS-denied environments such as indoors. However, localization using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) suffers from drift caused by motion-process noise and sensor biases. This paper introduces Uncertainty-aware Map-constrained Inertial Localization (UMLoc), an end-to-end framework that jointly models IMU uncertainty and map constraints to achieve drift-resilient positioning. UMLoc integrates two coupled modules: (1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) quantile regressor, which estimates the specific quantiles needed to define 68%, 90%, and 95% prediction intervals serving as a measure of localization uncertainty and (2) a Conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with cross-attention that fuses IMU dynamic data with distance-based floor-plan maps to generate geometrically feasible trajectories. The modules are trained jointly, allowing uncertainty estimates to propagate through the CGAN during trajectory generation. UMLoc was evaluated on three datasets, including a newly collected 2-hour indoor benchmark with time-aligned IMU data, ground-truth poses and floor-plan maps. Results show that the method achieves a mean drift ratio of 5.9% over a 70 m travel distance and an average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 1.36 m, while maintaining calibrated prediction bounds.",

      "abstract": "A method of information transmission using visual markers has been widely studied. In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker.",

Our simulator adopts MLS-MPM as its computational core, reducing numerical dissipation and energy drift while preserving rotational and shear responses even under topology-changing cuts. During cutting, forces and stress distributions are estimated from impulse exchanges between particles and the grid, enabling stable tracking of transient contact forces and energy transfer.\n  We also provide a benchmark dataset that integrates diverse cutting trajectories, multi-view visual observations, and fine-grained language instructions, together with force--torque and tool--pose labels to provide physically consistent training signals.\n  These components realize a learning--evaluation loop that respects the core physics of cutting and establishes a safe, reproducible, and scalable foundation for advancing VLA models in deformable object manipulation.",

When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments. This will serve as a foundation to include the relations of functional and actionable elements, which then can be used for dynamic simulation and reasoning.

      "abstract": "The increasing complexity of distributed robotics has driven the need for platforms that seamlessly integrate edge, fog, and cloud computing layers while meeting strict real-time constraints. This paper introduces BlazeAIoT, a modular multi-layer platform designed to unify distributed robotics across heterogeneous infrastructures. BlazeAIoT provides dynamic data transfer, configurable services, and integrated monitoring, while ensuring resilience, security, and programming language flexibility. The architecture leverages Kubernetes-based clusters, broker interoperability (DDS, Kafka, Redis, and ROS2), and adaptive data distribution mechanisms to optimize communication and computation across diverse environments. The proposed solution includes a multi-layer configuration service, dynamic and adaptive data bridging, and hierarchical rate limiting to handle large messages. The platform is validated through robotics scenarios involving navigation and artificial intelligence-driven large-scale message processing, demonstrating robust performance under real-time constraints. Results highlight BlazeAIoT's ability to dynamically allocate services across incomplete topologies, maintain system health, and minimize latency, making it a cost-aware, scalable solution for robotics and broader IoT applications, such as smart cities and smart factories.",

      "abstract": "Bipedal humanoid robots must precisely coordinate balance, timing, and contact decisions when locomoting on constrained footholds such as stepping stones, beams, and planks -- even minor errors can lead to catastrophic failure. Classical optimization and control pipelines handle these constraints well but depend on highly accurate mathematical representations of terrain geometry, making them prone to error when perception is noisy or incomplete. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning has shown strong resilience to disturbances and modeling errors, yet end-to-end policies rarely discover the precise foothold placement and step sequencing required for discontinuous terrain. These contrasting limitations motivate approaches that guide learning with physics-based structure rather than relying purely on reward shaping. In this work, we introduce a locomotion framework in which a reduced-order stepping planner supplies dynamically consistent motion targets that steer the RL training process via Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) rewards. This combination of structured footstep planning and data-driven adaptation produces accurate, agile, and hardware-validated stepping-stone locomotion on a humanoid robot, substantially improving reliability compared to conventional model-free reinforcement-learning baselines.",

Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy.

However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines.

From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories.

This system enables passengers to issue high-level commands, from querying status information to modifying driving behavior. Our methodology is grounded in three key components: a taxonomization of interaction categories, an application-centric Domain Specific Language (DSL) for command translation, and a safety-preserving validation layer. A two-stage LLM architecture ensures high transparency by providing feedback based on the definitive execution status. Evaluation confirms the system's timing efficiency and translation robustness. Simulation successfully validated command execution across all five interaction categories.

We evaluated InsSo3D performance inside a test tank with access to ground truth data and in an outdoor flooded quarry. Comparisons to reference trajectories and maps obtained from an underwater motion tracking system and visual Structure From Motion (SFM) demonstrate that InsSo3D efficiently corrects odometry drift.

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Its diagnosis by biopsy requires a high level of expertise and precision from the surgeon, so the results are highly operator-dependent. The aim of this work is to develop a robotic system for assisted ultrasound (US) examination of the prostate, a prebiopsy step that could reduce the dexterity requirements and enable faster, more accurate and more available prostate biopsy. We developed and validated a laboratory setup with a collaborative robotic arm that can autonomously scan a prostate phantom and attached the phantom to a medical robotic arm that mimics the patient's movements. The scanning robot keeps the relative position of the US probe and the prostate constant, ensuring a consistent and robust approach to reconstructing the prostate. To reconstruct the prostate, each slice is segmented to generate a series of prostate contours converted into a 3D point cloud used for biopsy planning. The average scan time of the prostate was 30 s, and the average 3D reconstruction of the prostate took 3 s. We performed four motion scenarios: the phantom was scanned in a stationary state (S), with horizontal motion (H), with vertical motion (V), and with a combination of the two (C). System validation is performed by registering the prostate point cloud reconstructions acquired during different motions (H, V, C) with those obtained in the stationary state. ICP registration with a threshold of 0.8 mm yields mean 83.2\\% fitness and 0.35 mm RMSE for S-H registration, 84.1\\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-V registration and 79.4\\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-C registration. Due to the elastic and soft material properties of the prostate phantom, the maximum robot tracking error was 3 mm, which can be sufficient for prostate biopsy according to medical literature. The maximum delay in motion compensation was 0.5 s.",

EvoQRE integrates a pre-trained generative world model with entropy-regularized replicator dynamics, capturing stochastic human behavior while maintaining equilibrium structure. We provide rigorous theoretical results, proving that the proposed dynamics converge to Logit-QRE under a two-timescale stochastic approximation with an explicit convergence rate of O(log k / k^{1/3}) under weak monotonicity assumptions. We further extend QRE to continuous action spaces using mixture-based and energy-based policy representations. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that EvoQRE achieves state-of-the-art realism, improved safety metrics, and controllable generation of diverse safety-critical scenarios through interpretable rationality parameters.",

This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor. Results demonstrate accurate contact estimation and localization with errors under 7 mm, demonstrating the potential of whisker-based sensing as a lightweight, adaptable complement to vision-based navigation.",

We model latent tasks as probabilistic formal languages and introduce a tailored reactive synthesis framework that balances robot costs with user task preferences. Our methodology focuses on safety-constrained learning and inferring formal task specifications as Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA). We adapt existing evidence-driven state merging algorithms and incorporate safety requirements throughout the learning process to ensure that the learned PDFA always complies with safety constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-objective reactive synthesis algorithm that generates deterministic strategies that are guaranteed to satisfy the PDFA task while optimizing the trade-offs between user preferences and robot costs, resulting in a Pareto front of optimal solutions. Our approach models the interaction as a two-player game between the robot and the environment, accounting for dynamic changes. We present a computationally-tractable value iteration algorithm to generate the Pareto front and the corresponding deterministic strategies. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across various robots and tasks, showing that the learned PDFA never includes unsafe behaviors and that synthesized strategies consistently achieve the task while meeting both the robot cost and user-preference requirements.",

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.",

      "abstract": "Task-oriented dexterous grasping remains challenging in robotic manipulations of open-world objects under severe partial observation, where significant missing data invalidates generic shape completion. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we study Task-Oriented Shape Completion, a new task that focuses on completing the potential contact regions rather than the entire shape. We argue that shape completion for grasping should be explicitly guided by the downstream manipulation task. To achieve this, we first generate multiple task-oriented shape completion candidates by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of object functional understanding from several pre-trained foundation models. A 3D discriminative autoencoder is then proposed to evaluate the plausibility of each generated candidate and optimize the most plausible one from a global perspective. A conditional flow-matching model named FlowGrasp is developed to generate task-oriented dexterous grasps from the optimized shape. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in task-oriented dexterous grasping and task-oriented shape completion, improving the Grasp Displacement and the Chamfer Distance over the state-of-the-art by 16.17\\% and 55.26%, respectively. In particular, it shows good capabilities in grasping objects with severe missing data. It also demonstrates good generality in handling open-set categories and tasks.",

Upcoming decades focus on building a lunar outpost, with robotic systems playing a crucial role to safely and efficiently establish essential infrastructure such as solar power generating towers. Similar to the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), shipping necessary components via modules and assembling them in situ should be a practical scenario. In this context, this paper focuses on the integration of vision, control, and hardware systems within an autonomous sequence for a dual-arm robot system. We explore a perception and control pipeline specifically designed for assembling solar panel modules, one of the benchmark tasks. Ad hoc hardware was designed and tested in real-world experiments. A mock-up of modular solar panels and active-passive connectors are employed, with the control of this grappling fixture integrated into the proposed pipeline. The successful implementation of our method demonstrates that the two robot manipulators can effectively connect arbitrarily placed panels, highlighting the seamless integration of vision, control, and hardware systems in complex space applications.",

      "abstract": "Non-injective functions are not invertible. However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same. Further, even if the dimensionalities do not match it is often possible to choose a preferred solution from many possible solutions. Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{new}}$. In combination with k-nearest neighbor search, I propose a deterministic framework that finds input parameters to a given target variable of non-injective functions. The method is demonstrated by inverting non-injective functions describing toy problems and robot arm control that are a) defined by data or b) known as mathematical formula.",

      "abstract": "Automating experimental protocol design and execution remains as a fundamental bottleneck in realizing self-driving laboratories. We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.",

Eye gaze offers a fast, non-intrusive, and intent-rich input modality, making it an attractive channel for conveying user goals.

By contextualizing gaze fixations within the scene, the system maps visual attention to high-level semantic understanding, enabling skill selection and parameterization without task-specific training. We evaluate GAMMA on a range of table-top manipulation tasks and compare it against baseline gaze-based control without reasoning. Results demonstrate that GAMMA provides robust, intuitive, and generalizable control, highlighting the potential of combining foundation models and gaze for natural and scalable robot autonomy.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation. Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

In this work, we present CorDex, a framework that robustly learns dexterous functional grasps of novel objects from synthetic data generated from just a single human demonstration. At the core of our approach is a correspondence-based data engine that generates diverse, high-quality training data in simulation. Based on the human demonstration, our data engine generates diverse object instances of the same category, transfers the expert grasp to the generated objects through correspondence estimation, and adapts the grasp through optimization. Building on the generated data, we introduce a multimodal prediction network that integrates visual and geometric information. By devising a local-global fusion module and an importance-aware sampling mechanism, we enable robust and computationally efficient prediction of functional dexterous grasps. Through extensive experiments across various object categories, we demonstrate that CorDex generalizes well to unseen object instances and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "abstract": "The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.",

      "abstract": "Despite advances in upper-limb (UL) prosthetic design, achieving intuitive control of intermediate joints - such as the wrist and elbow - remains challenging, particularly for continuous and velocity-modulated movements. We introduce a novel movement-based control paradigm entitled Compensation Effect Amplification Control (CEAC) that leverages users' trunk flexion and extension as input for controlling prosthetic elbow velocity. Considering that the trunk can be both a functional and compensatory joint when performing upper-limb actions, CEAC amplifies the natural coupling between trunk and prosthesis while introducing a controlled delay that allows users to modulate both the position and velocity of the prosthetic joint. We evaluated CEAC in a generic drawing task performed by twelve able-bodied participants using a supernumerary prosthesis with an active elbow. Additionally a multiple-target-reaching task was performed by a subset of ten participants. Results demonstrate task performances comparable to those obtained with natural arm movements, even when gesture velocity or drawing size were varied, while maintaining ergonomic trunk postures. Analysis revealed that CEAC effectively restores joint coordinated action, distributes movement effort between trunk and elbow, enabling intuitive trajectory control without requiring extreme compensatory movements. Overall, CEAC offers a promising control strategy for intermediate joints of UL prostheses, particularly in tasks requiring continuous and precise coordination.",

However, even state-of-the-art methods often degrade under unseen conditions, highlighting the need for robust and generalizable robot sensing. The RoboSense 2025 Challenge is designed to advance robustness and adaptability in robot perception across diverse sensing scenarios. It unifies five complementary research tracks spanning language-grounded decision making, socially compliant navigation, sensor configuration generalization, cross-view and cross-modal correspondence, and cross-platform 3D perception. Together, these tasks form a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating real-world sensing reliability under domain shifts, sensor failures, and platform discrepancies. RoboSense 2025 provides standardized datasets, baseline models, and unified evaluation protocols, enabling large-scale and reproducible comparison of robust perception methods. The challenge attracted 143 teams from 85 institutions across 16 countries, reflecting broad community engagement. By consolidating insights from 23 winning solutions, this report highlights emerging methodological trends, shared design principles, and open challenges across all tracks, marking a step toward building robots that can sense reliably, act robustly, and adapt across platforms in real-world environments.",

      "title": "When to Act: Calibrated Confidence for Reliable Human Intention Prediction in Assistive Robotics",
      "abstract": "Assistive devices must determine both what a user intends to do and how reliable that prediction is before providing support. We introduce a safety-critical triggering framework based on calibrated probabilities for multimodal next-action prediction in Activities of Daily Living. Raw model confidence often fails to reflect true correctness, posing a safety risk. Post-hoc calibration aligns predicted confidence with empirical reliability and reduces miscalibration by about an order of magnitude without affecting accuracy. The calibrated confidence drives a simple ACT/HOLD rule that acts only when reliability is high and withholds assistance otherwise. This turns the confidence threshold into a quantitative safety parameter for assisted actions and enables verifiable behavior in an assistive control loop.",
