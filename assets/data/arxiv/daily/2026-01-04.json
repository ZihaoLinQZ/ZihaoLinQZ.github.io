      "title": "SpaceTimePilot: Generative Rendering of Dynamic Scenes Across Space and Time",
      "abstract": "We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

      "title": "GaMO: Geometry-aware Multi-view Diffusion Outpainting for Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

      "abstract": "We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.",

      "abstract": "Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.",

To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe.

To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

      "title": "From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing",
      "abstract": "Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.\n  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.\n  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.",

      "abstract": "Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.",

In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.",

We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection.

These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.",

      "abstract": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.",

      "abstract": "Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.",

We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.",

To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.",

      "abstract": "Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.",

While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.",

However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task.

In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics.

To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis.

We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models.

In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts.

In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence.

      "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels",

The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.",

However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.",

The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually.

These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.\n  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.\n  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.",

However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach.

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).",

STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.",

This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control.

Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking.

      "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.",

RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.",

      "abstract": "We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.",

      "abstract": "Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.",

      "abstract": "Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.",

      "abstract": "Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.\n  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.",

The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model.

      "abstract": "Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.",

The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches.

At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting.

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines.

      "abstract": "Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.",

      "abstract": "Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.",

We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.",

      "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.",

The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.",

A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator.

By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.",

Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.",

We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks.

      "abstract": "Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.",

      "abstract": "We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.",

      "abstract": "Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.",

      "abstract": "Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.",

      "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.",

This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.",

      "abstract": "The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images.

Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.",

      "title": "Gradient Descent as Implicit EM in Distance-Based Neural Models",
      "abstract": "Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.",

However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.",

This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.",

      "abstract": "We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.",

This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.",

Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel \"Embedding-to-Label\" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.",

Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains.

To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness.

We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency.

Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.",

      "abstract": "Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.",

This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.\n  We propose \\textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.",

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.",

However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.",

We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets.",

Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.",

While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from \"passive detection\" to \"intelligent diagnosis\" for battery safety management.",

We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.",

      "abstract": "Target search and tracking (SAT) is a fundamental problem for various robotic applications such as search and rescue and environmental exploration. This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

      "abstract": "We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.\n  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.",

Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.",

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.",

      "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.",

Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.",

      "abstract": "We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.",

Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations.",

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.",

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.",

      "abstract": "Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.",

      "abstract": "State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation. Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/",

      "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.",

We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.",

We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.",

      "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

      "abstract": "Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named \"FireRescue\" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.",

      "abstract": "Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled \"Commonsense-STEM-Agent\" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.",

DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior.

Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \\textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \\textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \\textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \\textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\\%) and GAIA (72.8\\%) using open-weight models.

To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.",

The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.",

      "abstract": "3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.",

      "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.",

      "abstract": "Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.",

We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.",

Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.",

While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.",

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.",

To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations.

      "abstract": "Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.",

We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.",

Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.",

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.",

      "abstract": "Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.",

However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.",

      "abstract": "In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.",

      "title": "From Building Blocks to Planning: Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning in LLMs with Reinforcement Learning",
      "abstract": "Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).\n  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.\n  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.",

However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.",

We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost.

      "abstract": "Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.",

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.",

However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.",

      "abstract": "Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.",

      "abstract": "Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.",

Recent generative steganography methods, particularly those based on diffusion models, can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders, creating significant challenges for detection and remediation. Coverless diffusion-based techniques are difficult to counter because they generate image carriers directly from secret data, enabling attackers to deliver stegomalware for command-and-control, payload staging, and data exfiltration while bypassing detectors that rely on cover-stego discrepancies. This work introduces Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a training-free defense for security gateways that neutralizes hidden payloads rather than detecting them. ADS employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders and incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits. Under a practical threat model and in evaluation against the state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method Pulsar, ADS drives decoder success rates to near zero with minimal perceptual impact. Results demonstrate that ADS provides a favorable security-utility trade-off compared to standard content transformations, offering an effective mitigation strategy against diffusion-driven steganography.",

We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees.

Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18.

Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

      "abstract": "With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.",

      "abstract": "The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.",

Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.\n  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.",

      "abstract": "Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.",

In this paper, we present \\textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \\textbf{153.2}\\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \\textbf{179.6}\\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation.

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.",

While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.",

We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm.

Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.",

Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space.

      "abstract": "3D meshes are a fundamental representation widely used in computer science and engineering. In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.",

      "abstract": "Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.",

We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.",

      "abstract": "The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.",

This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.",

Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.",

The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.",

To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.\n  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.",

TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.",

Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.",

This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).",

We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \\times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.",

      "abstract": "The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.",

Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.",

They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities.

      "abstract": "Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.",

In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.",

To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.",

      "abstract": "The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.",

Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.",

      "abstract": "Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.\n  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.",

Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.",

FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.",

We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing.

We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.",

      "abstract": "Real-world reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to training precise and dexterous robotic manipulation policies in an online manner, enabling robots to learn from their own experience while gradually reducing human labor. However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.",

SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.",

      "abstract": "Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.",

      "abstract": "Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.",

In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios, demonstrating the fastest planning speed",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.",

      "abstract": "A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.",

      "abstract": "When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.",

      "abstract": "Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to \"regression-to-the-mean\", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning.

FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds.

Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios.

While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

      "abstract": "Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

      "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere\" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.",

      "abstract": "Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.",

      "abstract": "Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.",

Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.",

      "abstract": "Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns.

However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs.

      "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.",

Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.",

      "abstract": "We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.",

However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.",

We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains.

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \\(1-α\\pm δ\\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk.

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.",

      "abstract": "On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.",

      "abstract": "General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.",

We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance.

      "abstract": "Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.",

Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.",

We introduce a \"temporal-first\" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the \"temporal-first\" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint.

As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.",

However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent \"Black-Box\" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.",

Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety.

To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.",

While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.",

      "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

      "abstract": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily been driven by resource-rich research groups and industry partners. Due to the lack of on-premise computing resources required for increasingly complex models, many researchers are turning to cloud services like AWS SageMaker to train Hugging Face models. However, the steep learning curve of cloud platforms often presents a barrier for researchers accustomed to local environments. Existing documentation frequently leaves knowledge gaps, forcing users to seek fragmented information across the web. This demo paper aims to democratize cloud adoption by centralizing the essential information required for researchers to successfully train their first Hugging Face model on AWS SageMaker from scratch.",

      "abstract": "Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.",

Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models. Furthermore, HY-MT1.5-7B establishes a new state-of-the-art for its size class, achieving 95% of Gemini-3.0-Pro's performance on Flores-200 and surpassing it on the challenging WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language test sets. Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.",

      "abstract": "In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.",

      "abstract": "Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",

To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods.

However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.",

To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.",

Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience. We highlight critical gaps and call for further refinement of detection accuracy and usability in LLM safety systems.",

Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.",

We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions.

To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).",

Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

      "abstract": "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.\n  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.\n  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.\n  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees.",

However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.",

Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control.

      "abstract": "Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.",

However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces SHIELD, a Spherical-Projection Hybrid-Frontier Integration for Efficient LiDAR-based Drone exploration method. Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.",

      "abstract": "Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.",

Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.",

      "title": "Learning to Feel the Future: DreamTacVLA for Contact-Rich Manipulation",
      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.",

      "abstract": "Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.",

      "abstract": "Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.",

      "abstract": "This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.",

In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.",

      "abstract": "The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.",

In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.",

RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.",

In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation.

      "abstract": "AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.",

      "abstract": "The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

      "abstract": "Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.",

Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.",

We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench\n  Code: https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench",

Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.",

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

      "abstract": "Path planning is a fundamental component in autonomous mobile robotics, enabling a robot to navigate from its current location to a desired goal while avoiding obstacles. Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity. Comparative analyses are conducted against standard APF, adaptive APF, and well-established planning algorithms such as A*, PRM, and RRT. Results demonstrate that the Bulldozer technique effectively resolves the local minima problem while achieving superior execution speed and competitive path quality. Furthermore, a kinematic tracking controller is employed to assess the smoothness and traceability of the planned paths, confirming their suitability for real-world execution.",

We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of \"motion = content + style\", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity.

Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding.

Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media.

We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap.

      "abstract": "The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.",

      "abstract": "Lengthy setup processes that require robotics expertise remain a major barrier to deploying robots for tasks involving high product variability and small batch sizes. As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.",

Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.",

      "abstract": "China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.",

      "abstract": "Steer-by-Wire systems replace mechanical linkages, which provide benefits like weight reduction, design flexibility, and compatibility with autonomous driving. However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions.",

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.",

      "abstract": "Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.",

We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score.

      "abstract": "Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified structure with a concise model, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. A common assumption in unified vision-language models is that adding generation will naturally strengthen understanding. However, this is not always true at scale. At 200M+ pretraining samples, generation helps understanding only when it operates at the semantic level, i.e. when the model learns to autoregress high-level visual representations inside the LLM. Once pixel-level objectives (e.g., diffusion losses) directly interfere with the LLM, understanding performance often degrades. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. Unified generation-understanding demonstrates a superior scaling trend compared to understanding alone, revealing a more effective way to learn vision-only knowledge directive from vision modality rather than captioning to text. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details. Compared to the commonly-used vision encoder, make visual autoregression on input embedding shows less cumulative error and is modality independent, which can be extend to all modalities. The learned semantic representations capture visual information such as objects, locations, shapes, and colors; further enable pixel-level image generation.",

      "abstract": "Today's heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) face two transitions: from diesel-hydraulic actuation to clean electric systems driven by climate goals, and from human supervision toward greater autonomy. Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.\n  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.\n  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.\n  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as \"Wave\" and \"Echo\" quotations.\n  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.\n  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.",

      "abstract": "Within the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), Theory of Mind (ToM) is intended to serve as a user-friendly backend to the interface of robotic systems, enabling robots to infer and respond to human mental states. When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.",

      "abstract": "Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.",

Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.",

By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving.\n  Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \\textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents.

This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering.

Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.",

      "abstract": "In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems.",

However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.",

However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.",

      "abstract": "As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have accelerated inverse-kinematics (IK) inference to the point where low cost manipulators can execute complex trajectories in real time, yet the opaque nature of these models contradicts the transparency and safety requirements emerging in responsible AI regulation. This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized inspection tasks by offering a safer, more efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional methods. However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483). Finally, this online platform (https://sites.google.com/view/mudai-platform/) allows interested readers to interact with the mUDAI method and generate their own multi UAV FISR missions.",

      "abstract": "Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a vital bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving driving flexibility and gradually building driver trust and acceptance of autonomous technology. To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.",

      "abstract": "Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.",

While classical SMC has demonstrated empirical success, it can suffer from gradient cancellation, particularly when agents are initialized near symmetry points of the target distribution, leading to undesirable behaviors such as stalling or motion constrained along symmetry axes. In this work, we rigorously characterize the initial conditions and symmetry-induced invariant manifolds that give rise to such directional degeneracy in first-order agent dynamics. To address this, we introduce a stochastic perturbation combined with a contraction term and prove that the resulting dynamics ensure almost-sure escape from zero-gradient manifolds while maintaining mean-square boundedness of agent trajectories. Simulations on symmetric multi-modal reference distributions demonstrate that the proposed stochastic SMC effectively mitigates transient stalling and axis-constrained motion, while ensuring that all agent trajectories remain bounded within the domain.",

Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.",

Using this framework, we present a comparative analysis of Contrastive Learning (CL) and Supervised Learning (SL) paradigms. Our findings reveal that CL induces a more robust feature space for sparse geometry, achieving superior retrieval performance particularly in the 5--10m range.

      "abstract": "In robotics, it is common to check whether a given robot state results in self-intersection (i.e., a self-collision query) or to assess its distance from such an intersection (i.e., a self-proximity query). These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.",

Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines. URDD provides a unified, extensible resource for reducing redundancy and establishing shared standards across robotics frameworks.

While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as \"walking forward with an upright posture,\" the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation.

      "abstract": "An aerial manipulator, comprising a multirotor base and a robotic arm, is subject to significant dynamic coupling between these two components. Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.",

      "abstract": "Traditional geometric inverse kinematics methods for parallel mechanisms rely on specific spatial geometry constraints. However, their application to redundant parallel mechanisms is challenged due to the increased constraint complexity. Moreover, it will output no solutions and cause unpredictable control problems when the target pose lies outside its workspace. To tackle these challenging issues, this work proposes P-FABRIK, a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics method to find one feasible solution for diverse parallel mechanisms based on the FABRIK algorithm. By decomposing the general parallel mechanism into multiple serial sub-chains using a new topological decomposition strategy, the end targets of each sub-chain can be subsequently revised to calculate the inverse kinematics solutions iteratively. Multiple case studies involving planar, standard, and redundant parallel mechanisms demonstrated the proposed method's generality across diverse parallel mechanisms. Furthermore, numerical simulation studies verified its efficacy and computational efficiency, as well as its robustness ability to handle out-of-workspace targets.",

      "abstract": "Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

      "abstract": "The computational power of autonomous mobile robots under the Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model has been widely studied through an extensive hierarchy of robot models defined by the presence of memory, communication, and synchrony assumptions. While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.",

      "abstract": "In mobile robotics, coverage navigation refers to the deliberate movement of a robot with the purpose of covering a certain area or volume. Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment.

      "abstract": "One of the main limitations of multirotor UAVs is their short flight time due to battery constraints. A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.",

To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning.

      "abstract": "Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.\n  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.\n  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.",

      "abstract": "Ball-end milling path planning on multiply connected freeform surfaces is pivotal for high-quality and efficient machining of components in automotive and aerospace manufacturing. Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%. The strategy offers broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.\n  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.",

The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.",

      "title": "Emergence of Human to Robot Transfer in Vision-Language-Action Models",
      "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models can enable broad open world generalization, but require large and diverse datasets. It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.",

The platform employs a heterogeneous computing architecture, with RPi 5 and ROS 2 handling AI-based perception and path planning, while ESP32 running FreeRTOS ensures real-time motor control. The mechanical design was optimized for payload capacity and mobility through precise motor selection and material engineering. Key technical challenges addressed include optimizing computationally intensive AI algorithms on a resource-constrained platform and implementing a low-latency, reliable communication link between the ROS 2 host and embedded controller. Results demonstrate deterministic, PID-based motor control through rigorous memory and task management, and enhanced system reliability via AWS IoT monitoring and a firmware-level motor shutdown failsafe. This work highlights a unified, multi-disciplinary methodology, resulting in a robust and operational autonomous delivery system capable of real-world deployment.",

      "title": "VL-LN Bench: Towards Long-horizon Goal-oriented Navigation with Active Dialogs",
      "abstract": "In most existing embodied navigation tasks, instructions are well-defined and unambiguous, such as instruction following and object searching. Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

      "abstract": "Endotracheal intubation is a critical yet technically demanding procedure, with failure or improper tube placement leading to severe complications. Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.",

Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations.",

However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.",
