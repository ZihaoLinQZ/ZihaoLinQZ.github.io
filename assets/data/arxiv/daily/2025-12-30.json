      "abstract": "Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

      "title": "Training AI Co-Scientists Using Rubric Rewards",
      "abstract": "AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.",

      "title": "Diffusion Knows Transparency: Repurposing Video Diffusion for Transparent Object Depth and Normal Estimation",
      "abstract": "Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.",

      "title": "Robo-Dopamine: General Process Reward Modeling for High-Precision Robotic Manipulation",
      "abstract": "The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

      "abstract": "Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability.",

      "abstract": "We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.",

      "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench\n  Code: https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench",

We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect.

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Path planning is a fundamental component in autonomous mobile robotics, enabling a robot to navigate from its current location to a desired goal while avoiding obstacles. Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity. Comparative analyses are conducted against standard APF, adaptive APF, and well-established planning algorithms such as A*, PRM, and RRT. Results demonstrate that the Bulldozer technique effectively resolves the local minima problem while achieving superior execution speed and competitive path quality. Furthermore, a kinematic tracking controller is employed to assess the smoothness and traceability of the planned paths, confirming their suitability for real-world execution.",

We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.\n  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.",

      "abstract": "Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.",

We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of \"motion = content + style\", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity. Experimental validation shows that RoboPerform achieves promising results in physical plausibility and audio alignment, successfully transforming robots into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio.",

Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines.

To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.",

Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset",

      "abstract": "Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.",

      "abstract": "One-to-one tutoring is widely considered the gold standard for personalized education, yet it remains prohibitively expensive to scale. To evaluate whether generative AI might help expand access to this resource, we conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with $N = 165$ students across five UK secondary schools. We integrated LearnLM -- a generative AI model fine-tuned for pedagogy -- into chat-based tutoring sessions on the Eedi mathematics platform. In the RCT, expert tutors directly supervised LearnLM, with the remit to revise each message it drafted until they would be satisfied sending it themselves. LearnLM proved to be a reliable source of pedagogical instruction, with supervising tutors approving 76.4% of its drafted messages making zero or minimal edits (i.e., changing only one or two characters). This translated into effective tutoring support: students guided by LearnLM performed at least as well as students chatting with human tutors on each learning outcome we measured. In fact, students who received support from LearnLM were 5.5 percentage points more likely to solve novel problems on subsequent topics (with a success rate of 66.2%) than those who received tutoring from human tutors alone (rate of 60.7%). In interviews, tutors highlighted LearnLM's strength at drafting Socratic questions that encouraged deeper reflection from students, with multiple tutors even reporting that they learned new pedagogical practices from the model. Overall, our results suggest that pedagogically fine-tuned AI tutoring systems may play a promising role in delivering effective, individualized learning support at scale.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

      "abstract": "Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.",

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.",

As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.",

We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.",

      "abstract": "China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.",

However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.",

We resolve this tension with a novel model selection method that jointly optimizes model class and training window size using a tournament procedure that adaptively evaluates candidates on non-stationary validation data. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight.

During NBER-designated recessions, improvements are substantial: our method achieves positive $R^2$ during the Gulf War recession while benchmarks are negative, and improves $R^2$ in absolute terms by at least 80bps during the 2001 recession as well as superior performance during the 2008 Financial Crisis.

First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection.

However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions.",

Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/",

The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.",

      "abstract": "Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.",

      "abstract": "Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.",

Through a focus group with twelve creative technologists, we then used Sumbrella as a technological probe to explore how people interpreted, interacted, and imagined future relationships with soft robotic wearables.

We contribute to the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field key considerations and recommendations for designing soft robotic garments, including the potential for kinesic communication, the impact of such technologies on social dynamics, and the importance of ethical guidelines.

In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Powerful autonomous systems, which reason, plan, and converse using and between numerous tools and agents, are made possible by Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and new agentic AI systems, like LangChain and GraphChain. Nevertheless, this agentic environment increases the probability of the occurrence of multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks, in which concealed or malicious instructions carried in text, pictures, metadata, or agent-to-agent messages may spread throughout the graph and lead to unintended behavior, a breach of policy, or corruption of state. In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable. The framework, which expands the concept of provenance tracking and validation to the multi-agent orchestration, enhances the establishment of secure, understandable and reliable agentic AI systems.",

Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

      "abstract": "Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.",

      "abstract": "Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

      "abstract": "Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.",

To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.",

From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.",

By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.",

Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant. We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening.

Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.\n  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.\n  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.\n  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators.

Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as \"Wave\" and \"Echo\" quotations.\n  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.\n  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.",

In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.",

      "title": "The Gaining Paths to Investment Success: Information-Driven LLM Graph Reasoning for Venture Capital Prediction",
      "abstract": "Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

      "abstract": "We study how organizations should select among competing AI models when user utility, deployment costs, and compliance requirements jointly matter. Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice.",

A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.",

      "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.",

      "abstract": "Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.",

      "abstract": "The software supply chain attacks are becoming more and more focused on trusted development and delivery procedures, so the conventional post-build integrity mechanisms cannot be used anymore. The available frameworks like SLSA, SBOM and in toto are majorly used to offer provenance and traceability but do not have the capabilities of actively identifying and removing vulnerabilities in software production. The current paper includes an example of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on autonomous software supply chain security that combines large language model (LLM)-based reasoning, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent coordination. The suggested system utilizes specialized security agents coordinated with the help of LangChain and LangGraph, communicates with actual CI/CD environments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and documents all the observations and actions in a blockchain security ledger to ensure integrity and auditing. Reinforcement learning can be used to achieve adaptive mitigation strategies that consider the balance between security effectiveness and the operational overhead, and LLMs can be used to achieve semantic vulnerability analysis, as well as explainable decisions. This framework is tested based on simulated pipelines, as well as, actual world CI/CD integrations on GitHub Actions and Jenkins, including injection attacks, insecure deserialization, access control violations, and configuration errors. Experimental outcomes indicate better detection accuracy, shorter mitigation latency and reasonable build-time overhead than rule-based, provenance only and RL only baselines. These results show that agentic AI can facilitate the transition to self defending, proactive software supply chains rather than reactive verification ones.",

However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

      "abstract": "Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.",

      "abstract": "Reward models (RMs) are essential in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

      "abstract": "Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.",

      "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.",

Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors.

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.",

In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety.",

Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.",

Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality.

We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization.

Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness.

      "abstract": "In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems.",

      "abstract": "Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant risks to trustworthiness, manifesting primarily as stereotypical biases (e.g., gender or racial stereotypes) and structural biases (e.g., lexical overlap or position preferences). However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.",

Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance.

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.",

      "abstract": "As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.",

However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.",

      "abstract": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.",

However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment.

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.",

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.",

By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation.

      "abstract": "Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks \"Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the \"train once, deploy many\" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.",

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.",

In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification.

Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset.

Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency.\n  This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.\n  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario.

This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions.

Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.",

This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that addresses these issues through a dual-centric approach. From a Data-Centric perspective, we construct an iterative data factory that synthesizes RL-ready data characterized by high correctness and precise semantic-logic alignment, ensured by strict verification. From a Model-Centric perspective, we introduce a novel Agentic Reinforcement Learning framework. This framework employs a Diversity-Aware Cold Start stage to initialize a robust policy, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the agent's reasoning via environmental feedback.

However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks in recent years, including machine translation, text generation, and question answering. As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",

In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.",

To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM.

      "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.",

To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents.

We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.",

      "abstract": "We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.",

Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have accelerated inverse-kinematics (IK) inference to the point where low cost manipulators can execute complex trajectories in real time, yet the opaque nature of these models contradicts the transparency and safety requirements emerging in responsible AI regulation. This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.",

      "abstract": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.",

To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language.

      "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.",

To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures.

To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways.",

However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.",

Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.",

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.",

Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized inspection tasks by offering a safer, more efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional methods. However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483). Finally, this online platform (https://sites.google.com/view/mudai-platform/) allows interested readers to interact with the mUDAI method and generate their own multi UAV FISR missions.",

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.",

However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics.

Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.",

To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.",

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.",

An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses.

Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\\%, 6.5\\%, and 5.3\\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters.

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling.

      "abstract": "Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).",

      "abstract": "Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a vital bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving driving flexibility and gradually building driver trust and acceptance of autonomous technology. To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.",

      "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.",

      "abstract": "A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.",

In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.",

We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.",

We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans.

By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.",

The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA.

Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling.

      "title": "A Simple, Optimal and Efficient Algorithm for Online Exp-Concave Optimization",
      "abstract": "Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.",

      "abstract": "Generating medical reports from chest X-ray images is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists, especially in emergencies. To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple \"Add and LayerNorm\" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.",

      "abstract": "Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      "abstract": "Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\\frak p}$-th moment where ${\\frak p}\\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\\frak l}^{\\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\\frak l}\\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2{\\frak p}}\\ln^{1-1/{\\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ and ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/{\\frak p}}\\ln^{2-2/{\\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\\rm eff}\\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.",

      "abstract": "Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).",

While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.",

However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses.

In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate that EquaCode outperforms either the mathematical equation module or the code module alone. This suggests a strong synergistic effect, thereby demonstrating that multi-strategy approach yields results greater than the sum of its parts.",

It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the \"right to be forgotten.\" While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead.",

SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.",

      "abstract": "Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.",

      "abstract": "Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.",

While classical SMC has demonstrated empirical success, it can suffer from gradient cancellation, particularly when agents are initialized near symmetry points of the target distribution, leading to undesirable behaviors such as stalling or motion constrained along symmetry axes. In this work, we rigorously characterize the initial conditions and symmetry-induced invariant manifolds that give rise to such directional degeneracy in first-order agent dynamics. To address this, we introduce a stochastic perturbation combined with a contraction term and prove that the resulting dynamics ensure almost-sure escape from zero-gradient manifolds while maintaining mean-square boundedness of agent trajectories. Simulations on symmetric multi-modal reference distributions demonstrate that the proposed stochastic SMC effectively mitigates transient stalling and axis-constrained motion, while ensuring that all agent trajectories remain bounded within the domain.",

Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.",

      "abstract": "We consider the strongly NP-hard single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan. In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA.",

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum.",

However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.",

      "abstract": "In robotics, it is common to check whether a given robot state results in self-intersection (i.e., a self-collision query) or to assess its distance from such an intersection (i.e., a self-proximity query). These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.",

In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

      "abstract": "Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.",

As a result, downstream applications such as simulation, planning, and control must repeatedly re-derive richer data, leading to redundant computations, fragmented implementations, and limited standardization. In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines. URDD provides a unified, extensible resource for reducing redundancy and establishing shared standards across robotics frameworks. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations and implications of our work.",

However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees.

Larger models can be more vulnerable to introspection-driven jailbreaks and cross-modal manipulation. Traditional cybersecurity lacks ML-specific threat modeling for foundation, multimodal, and RAG systems. Objective: Characterize ML security risks by identifying dominant TTPs, vulnerabilities, and targeted lifecycle stages. Methods: We extract 93 threats from MITRE ATLAS (26), AI Incident Database (12), and literature (55), and analyze 854 GitHub/Python repositories. A multi-agent RAG system (ChatGPT-4o, temp 0.4) mines 300+ articles to build an ontology-driven threat graph linking TTPs, vulnerabilities, and stages. Results: We identify unreported threats including commercial LLM API model stealing, parameter memorization leakage, and preference-guided text-only jailbreaks. Dominant TTPs include MASTERKEY-style jailbreaking, federated poisoning, diffusion backdoors, and preference optimization leakage, mainly impacting pre-training and inference. Graph analysis reveals dense vulnerability clusters in libraries with poor patch propagation.

However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.",

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.",

In this work, we introduce a lightweight software library that bridges this gap by providing simple scripting interfaces for common robotics visualization tasks.

Together, these features allow robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without needing extensive Blender expertise.

OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism.

Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models.

Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.",

Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \\textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline.

While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as \"walking forward with an upright posture,\" the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation. These results suggest that VLMs can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control.",

Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.\n  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.\n  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

When $π_{\\text{roll}} \\ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.",

      "abstract": "Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

We propose FL with an L0 constraint on the density of non-zero parameters, achieved through a reparameterization using probabilistic gates and their continuous relaxation: originally proposed for sparsity in centralized machine learning. We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC). We compare the results with a magnitude pruning-based thresholding algorithm for sparsity in FL. Experiments on synthetic data with target density down to rho = 0.05 and publicly available RCV1, MNIST, and EMNIST datasets with target density down to rho = 0.005 demonstrate that our approach is communication-efficient and consistently better in statistical performance.",

To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.",

By reframing SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE), our method delivers O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, yielding a 94% reduction in peak VRAM and a 23x increase in throughput compared to standard Autograd. Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models.

      "abstract": "Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.",

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch.

      "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows. We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results. Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.",

We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model.

We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.",

      "abstract": "The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.",

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.",

This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying a high-performance, private LLM inference server at a cost accessible to Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). We present a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model based on Qwen3, running on a consumer-grade server equipped with a next-generation NVIDIA GPU. Unlike cloud-based offerings, which are expensive and complex to integrate, our approach provides an affordable and private solution for SMBs. We evaluate two dimensions: the model's intrinsic capabilities and the server's performance under load. Model performance is benchmarked against academic and industry standards to quantify reasoning and knowledge relative to cloud services. Concurrently, we measure server efficiency through latency, tokens per second, and time to first token, analyzing scalability under increasing concurrent users. Our findings demonstrate that a carefully configured on-premises setup with emerging consumer hardware and a quantized open-source model can achieve performance comparable to cloud-based services, offering SMBs a viable pathway to deploy powerful LLMs without prohibitive costs or privacy compromises.",

We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce.

LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%.

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

      "abstract": "Parameter-efficient continual learning has emerged as a promising approach for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across natural language tasks but incur substantial computational and storage costs due to their scale. Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.",

We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.",

To capture the dynamics of the environment and risk levels, we employ the function variation metric and introduce a novel risk-level variation metric. Two information settings are considered: a first-order scenario, where the learner observes both function values and their gradients; and a zeroth-order scenario, where only function evaluations are available. For both cases, we develop risk-averse learning algorithms with a limited sampling budget and analyze their dynamic regret bounds in terms of function variation, risk-level variation, and the total number of samples. The regret analysis demonstrates the adaptability of the algorithms in non-stationary and risk-sensitive settings.

      "abstract": "Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text \"in the left lower lung\", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.",

To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.",

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.",

To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism.

Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.",

However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.",

While deep learning has recently shown promise for single stopping problems, the multiple exercise case involves complex recursive dependencies that remain challenging. We address this by combining the Dynamic Programming Principle with neural network approximation of the value function. Unlike policy-search methods, our algorithm explicitly learns the value surface. We first consider the discrete-time problem and analyze neural network training error. We then turn to continuous problems and analyze the additional error due to the discretization of the underlying stochastic processes. Numerical experiments on high-dimensional American basket options and nonlinear utility maximization demonstrate that our method provides an efficient and scalable method for the multiple optimal stopping problem.",

      "abstract": "An aerial manipulator, comprising a multirotor base and a robotic arm, is subject to significant dynamic coupling between these two components. Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.",

Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated.

      "abstract": "High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.",

First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.",

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.",

Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.",

In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.",

In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

      "abstract": "Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \\textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \\textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \\textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \\textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \\textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \\textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.",

      "abstract": "Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.",

In this paper, we show that dark patterns are highly effective in steering agent trajectories, posing a significant risk to agent robustness. To quantify this risk, we introduce DECEPTICON, an environment for testing individual dark patterns in isolation. DECEPTICON includes 700 web navigation tasks with dark patterns -- 600 generated tasks and 100 real-world tasks, designed to measure instruction-following success and dark pattern effectiveness. Across state-of-the-art agents, we find dark patterns successfully steer agent trajectories towards malicious outcomes in over 70% of tested generated and real-world tasks -- compared to a human average of 31%. Moreover, we find that dark pattern effectiveness correlates positively with model size and test-time reasoning, making larger, more capable models more susceptible. Leading countermeasures against adversarial attacks, including in-context prompting and guardrail models, fail to consistently reduce the success rate of dark pattern interventions. Our findings reveal dark patterns as a latent and unmitigated risk to web agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against manipulative designs.",

Large language models now enable autonomous planning, tool orchestration, and strategic adaptation at scale, challenging security architectures built on static rules, perimeter defenses, and human-centered workflows. This chapter argues for a shift from prevention-centric security toward agentic cyber resilience. Rather than seeking perfect protection, resilient systems must anticipate disruption, maintain critical functions under attack, recover efficiently, and learn continuously. We situate this shift within the historical evolution of cybersecurity paradigms, culminating in an AI-augmented paradigm where autonomous agents participate directly in sensing, reasoning, action, and adaptation across cyber and cyber-physical systems. We then develop a system-level framework for designing agentic AI workflows. A general agentic architecture is introduced, and attacker and defender workflows are analyzed as coupled adaptive processes, and game-theoretic formulations are shown to provide a unifying design language for autonomy allocation, information flow, and temporal composition. Case studies in automated penetration testing, remediation, and cyber deception illustrate how equilibrium-based design enables system-level resiliency design.",

However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.",

MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.",

      "abstract": "The computational power of autonomous mobile robots under the Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model has been widely studied through an extensive hierarchy of robot models defined by the presence of memory, communication, and synchrony assumptions. While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.",

      "abstract": "We present an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm, within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm, which intelligently solicits informative demonstration trajectories for inferring an unknown constraint in the demonstrator's environment. Our approach iteratively trains a Gaussian process (GP) on the available demonstration dataset to represent the unknown constraints, uses the resulting GP posterior to query start/goal states, and generates informative demonstrations which are added to the dataset. Across simulation and hardware experiments using high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics and unknown nonlinear constraints, our method outperforms a baseline, random-sampling based method at accurately performing constraint inference from an iteratively generated set of sparse but informative demonstrations.",

      "abstract": "Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.",

However, adapting general-domain Large Language Models (LLMs) to this task is often hampered by their lack of domain-specific knowledge and the performance degradation caused by low-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce BioSelectTune, a highly efficient, data-centric framework for fine-tuning LLMs that prioritizes data quality over quantity. Methods and Results: BioSelectTune reformulates BioNER as a structured JSON generation task and leverages our novel Hybrid Superfiltering strategy, a weak-to-strong data curation method that uses a homologous weak model to distill a compact, high-impact training dataset. Conclusions: Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BioSelectTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. Notably, our model, trained on only 50% of the curated positive data, not only surpasses the fully-trained baseline but also outperforms powerful domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.",

      "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.",

      "abstract": "In mobile robotics, coverage navigation refers to the deliberate movement of a robot with the purpose of covering a certain area or volume. Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment.

Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \\emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \\emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \\emph{priming} and \\emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.",

Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.",

Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.",

We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.",

      "abstract": "Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.",

However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.",

However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.",

We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.",

We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.",

      "abstract": "While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.",

For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers.

      "abstract": "One of the main limitations of multirotor UAVs is their short flight time due to battery constraints. A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.",

To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.",

      "abstract": "While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning.

      "abstract": "Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.\n  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.\n  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.",

Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%. The strategy offers broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.",

A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level.

      "abstract": "Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.\n  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.",

      "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.",

      "abstract": "In collective motion, perceptually-limited individuals move in an ordered manner, without centralized control. The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.",

Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.",

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \\(82.2\\%\\) and TPR \\(78.9\\%\\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.",

It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.",

Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.",

      "abstract": "In most existing embodied navigation tasks, instructions are well-defined and unambiguous, such as instruction following and object searching. Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

      "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.",

      "abstract": "The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.",

      "abstract": "Agents based on large language models have recently shown strong potential on real-world software engineering (SWE) tasks that require long-horizon interaction with repository-scale codebases. However, most existing agents rely on append-only context maintenance or passively triggered compression heuristics, which often lead to context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-running interactions. We propose CAT, a new context management paradigm that elevates context maintenance to a callable tool integrated into the decision-making process of agents. CAT formalizes a structured context workspace consisting of stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, and high-fidelity short-term interactions, and enables agents to proactively compress historical trajectories into actionable summaries at appropriate milestones. To support context management for SWE-agents, we propose a trajectory-level supervision framework, CAT-GENERATOR, based on an offline data construction pipeline that injects context-management actions into complete interaction trajectories. Using this framework, we train a context-aware model, SWE-Compressor. Experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that SWE-Compressor reaches a 57.6% solved rate and significantly outperforms ReAct-based agents and static compression baselines, while maintaining stable and scalable long-horizon reasoning under a bounded context budget.",

However, these systems introduce distinct risks related to security, privacy, and regulatory compliance that are not fully addressed by existing AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces the Secure and Compliant NLP Lifecycle Management Framework (SC-NLP-LMF), a comprehensive six-phase model designed to ensure the secure operation of NLP systems from development to retirement. The framework, developed through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources, aligns with leading standards, including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS. It integrates established methods for bias detection, privacy protection (differential privacy, federated learning), secure deployment, explainability, and secure model decommissioning. A healthcare case study illustrates how SC-NLP-LMF detects emerging terminology drift (e.g., COVID-related language) and guides compliant model updates. The framework offers organizations a practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.",

      "abstract": "Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.",

Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.",

Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.",

This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of \"natural\" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits \"martial\" into \"mart\" and \"ial\"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how \"bad\" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Execution-based feedback like unit testing is widely used in the development of coding agents through test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.",

However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term \"statute\" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Multitask learning poses significant challenges due to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions. However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.",

Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a \"Gold Standard\" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.",

      "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.",

However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.",

This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.",

Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.",

Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.",

Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.",

      "abstract": "Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic (DA-MSA) translation is a challenging task in Machine Translation (MT) due to significant lexical, syntactic, and semantic divergences between Arabic dialects and MSA. Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks struggle to capture dialect-specific MT errors, hindering progress in translation assessment. This paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework designed to systematically address these challenges. The framework includes a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol. Through comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200), Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between these systems. The results show that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation. Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.",

When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask.

      "abstract": "Socially compliant navigation requires robots to move safely and appropriately in human-centered environments by respecting social norms. However, social norms are often ambiguous, and in a single scenario, multiple actions may be equally acceptable. Most existing methods simplify this problem by assuming a single correct action, which limits their ability to handle real-world social uncertainty. In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations. The dataset contains 789 samples, each with three-turn conversation, split into 710 training samples and 79 test samples through random selection. We also design five evaluation metrics to assess high-level decision precision, safety, and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAction-SocialNav achieves strong social reasoning performance while maintaining high efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world human robot navigation. Compared with zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude, our model achieves substantially higher decision quality (APG: 0.595 vs. 0.000/0.025) and safety alignment (ER: 0.264 vs. 0.642/0.668), while maintaining real-time efficiency (1.524 FPS, over 3x faster).",

      "abstract": "Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.",

We propose an image-centric memory framework that achieves long-term implicit memory via an efficient visual context compression module end-to-end coupled with a Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. Built atop a ViT backbone with frozen DINOv3 features and lightweight PixelUnshuffle+Conv blocks, our visual tokenizer supports configurable compression rates; for example, under a representative 16$\\times$ compression setting, each image is encoded with about 30 tokens, expanding the effective context capacity from tens to hundreds of images. Experimental results on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON show that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance, improving exploration in unfamiliar environments and shortening paths in familiar ones. Ablation studies further reveal that moderate compression provides the best balance between efficiency and accuracy. These findings position compressed image-centric memory as a practical and scalable interface for lifelong embodied agents, enabling them to reason over long visual histories and navigate with human-like efficiency.",

To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.",

Finally, we retarget the reconstructed motion to the Unitree G1 humanoid using a kinematics-aware two-stage inverse kinematics pipeline. Results on real monocular videos show that our method has stable world trajectories and reliable robot retargeting, indicating that structured human representations with lightweight physical constraints can yield robot-ready motion from monocular input.",

Compared with conventional planar ELJ, the helical configuration of HWS-ELJ provides exponentially increasing stiffness adjustment with winding angle, achieving significantly greater stiffness enhancement for the same electrode contact area while reducing the required footprint under equivalent stiffness conditions. Considering the practical advantage of voltage-based control, a series of experimental tests under different initial force conditions were conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulation characteristics of HWS-ELJ.

Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target.

However, a substantial amount of data from prior missions remain underutilized for path planning and autonomous navigation research. As a result, there is a lack of space mission-based planetary datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we take a step towards coordinating these three research directions in the context of planetary rover path planning. We propose the first two large planar benchmark datasets, MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench, derived from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. In addition, we set up classical and learned path planning algorithms, in a unified framework, and evaluate them on our proposed datasets and on a popular planning benchmark. Through comprehensive experiments, we report new insights on the performance of representative path planning algorithms on planetary terrains, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our results show that classical algorithms can achieve up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains such as Moon's north and south poles. This suggests, for instance, why these algorithms are used in practice by NASA. Conversely, learning-based models, although showing promising results in less complex environments, still struggle to generalize to planetary domains. To serve as a starting point for fundamental path planning research, our code and datasets will be released at: https://github.com/mchancan/PlanetaryPathBench.",

In the language modeling domain, test-time compute scaling has revolutionized reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs by leveraging additional inference-time compute for candidate solution refinement. These methods typically leverage foundation models as verification modules in a zero-shot manner to synthesize improved candidate solutions. In this work, we hypothesize that generative policies can similarly benefit from additional inference-time compute that employs zero-shot VLM-based verifiers. A systematic analysis of improving policy performance through the generation-verification framework remains relatively underexplored in the current literature. To this end, we introduce EVE - a modular, generator-verifier interaction framework - that boosts the performance of pretrained generative policies at test time, with no additional training. EVE wraps a frozen base policy with multiple zero-shot, VLM-based verifier agents. Each verifier proposes action refinements to the base policy candidate actions, while an action incorporator fuses the aggregated verifier output into the base policy action prediction to produce the final executed action. We study design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across a system of verifiers with distinct capabilities. Across a diverse suite of manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without any additional policy training. Through extensive ablations, we isolate the contribution of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies, offering practical guidelines to build scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control.",

      "abstract": "Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that promises to reduce travel time and alleviate congestion in urban transportation systems. As drone density increases, UAM operations are expected to experience congestion similar to that in ground traffic. However, the fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow, particularly under real-world operating conditions, remain poorly understood. This study proposes a general framework for constructing the fundamental diagram (FD) of UAM traffic by integrating theoretical analysis with physical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to derive a UAM FD using real-world physical test data. On the theoretical side, we design two drone control laws for collision avoidance and develop simulation-based traffic generation methods to produce diverse UAM traffic scenarios. Based on Edie's definition, traffic flow theory is then applied to construct the FD and characterize the macroscopic properties of UAM traffic. To account for real-world disturbances and modeling uncertainties, we further conduct physical experiments on a reduced-scale testbed using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones. Both simulation and physical test trajectory data are collected and organized into the UAMTra2Flow dataset, which is analyzed using the proposed framework. Preliminary results indicate that classical FD structures for ground transportation are also applicable to UAM systems. Notably, FD curves obtained from physical experiments exhibit deviations from simulation-based results, highlighting the importance of experimental validation. Finally, results from the reduced-scale testbed are scaled to realistic operating conditions to provide practical insights for future UAM traffic systems.

To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.",

However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.",

      "abstract": "Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.",

However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.",

      "abstract": "Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.",

By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.",

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.",

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.",

While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets. These commands are tracked by an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) attitude controller and a PID joint controller, respectively. Flight experiments demonstrate centimeter-level position accuracy and degree-level orientation precision, with robust performance under external force disturbances. The results highlight the potential of learning-based control strategies for enabling contact-rich aerial manipulation using simple, lightweight platforms.",

      "abstract": "Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.",

      "abstract": "Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.",

However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.",

We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an embodied agent to navigate towards target in continuous environments, following natural language instructions. While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Estimating the absolute orientation of a local system relative to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference often suffers from local minima and high dependency on satellite availability. Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice.

Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.",

      "abstract": "From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple \"scene\" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or \"tinkering\".

      "abstract": "Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.",

The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5. These results highlight the framework's generalizability, robustness, and computational efficiency.",

This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.",

      "title": "Anytime Metaheuristic Framework for Global Route Optimization in Expected-Time Mobile Search",
      "abstract": "Expected-time mobile search (ETS) is a fundamental robotics task where a mobile sensor navigates an environment to minimize the expected time required to locate a hidden object. Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.",

      "title": "LEAD: Minimizing Learner-Expert Asymmetry in End-to-End Driving",
      "abstract": "Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

      "abstract": "The Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League(A2RL) x Drone Champions League competition(DCL) requires teams to perform high-speed autonomous drone racing using only a single camera and a low-quality inertial measurement unit -- a minimal sensor set that mirrors expert human drone racing pilots. This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to drift from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly during long and fast flights with aggressive maneuvers. This paper presents the system developed for the championship, which achieved a competitive performance. Our approach corrected VIO drift by fusing its output with global position measurements derived from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. A perception-aware planner generated trajectories that balance speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system. The system demonstrated high performance, securing podium finishes across multiple categories: third place in the AI Grand Challenge with top speed of 43.2 km/h, second place in the AI Drag Race with over 59 km/h, and second place in the AI Multi-Drone Race. We detail the complete architecture and present a performance analysis based on experimental data from the competition, contributing our insights on building a successful system for monocular vision-based autonomous drone flight.",

      "title": "Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms",
      "abstract": "Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.",

      "abstract": "Underwater environments impose severe challenges to visual-inertial odometry systems, as strong light attenuation, marine snow and turbidity, together with weakly exciting motions, degrade inertial observability and cause frequent tracking failures over long-term operation. While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms.
